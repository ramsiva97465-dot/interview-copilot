# The router model, chosen, 2026-09-05

The method is in `natively-router-decision-method-2026-09-05.md`. This is the
result.

## The answer

A single fine tuned MiniLM-L6 encoder with one linear head per axis, quantized
to int8 ONNX, running in its own worker. Provider id `head-minilm`, 22.8 MB on
disk, p95 12.2 ms.

Not the composite, and not the prototype variant. Both score identically on the
two axes the router owns and both cost more latency.

## The table

English held out split, 1,011 rows, macro F1 percent, p95 milliseconds measured
inside the worker on Apple Silicon.

## Reading it

On needs_response, the axis that gates whether the assistant speaks, the model
scores 79.2 against an always guessing floor of 35.6. That margin of 43.6 points
is the evidence that it learned the task rather than the prior.

The shipped classifier scores 0.0 there, and that is an absence rather than a
failure. It has no needs_response output. Beating it on that axis is satisfied
by anything that emits the axis, which is why the floor is in the table.

On legacy_intent, the eight label taxonomy the shipped classifier actually
produces, the model scores 37.5 against production's 15.7. That is the only
head to head comparison available, and it comes with a caveat that matters: the
model was trained on these labels and production was not, so the gap is
flattering to the model. The honest reading is that production is weak here, not
that the model is strong.

On latency the comparison is clean and needs no caveat. 12.2 ms against 49.0 ms,
four times faster, and the shipped classifier is itself twice the 25 ms bar the
campaign set for its replacement.

## Why not the composite

The composite doubles mode_intent, 15.5 against 38.3, for 3.8 ms. That would be
worth it if mode_intent were the router's. It is not. `AXIS_OWNER` in
`electron/llm/routing/IntentFrame.ts` assigns mode_intent to Context
Intelligence V3, and gives the router needs_response and dialogue_act only. On
those two the composite and the plain head are identical to the decimal.

So the extra machinery buys an improvement on an axis the router does not ship.

## Why not head-deberta, now that it has been measured properly

It was previously recorded at 19.8 macro F1 with a note that it collapsed to one
class, and ruled out on that. The number was wrong. DeBERTa-v3-xsmall ships every
parameter as float16, the heads are fp32, and on MPS that produces a NaN loss
from the first step without raising. No gradient was ever applied, so the model
stayed at its random initialisation and the collapse detector reported exactly
what it saw. The training curve said `loss nan` on all twelve epochs and a dev
score frozen at 0.3230, which is what a measurement of nothing looks like.

Forcing fp32 in both the trainer and the exporter, and clearing a stale
external-data sidecar that was silently defeating quantization, gives it a fair
run:

    candidate         needs_resp  dialogue   legacy    p95ms   disk
    head-minilm             78.2      50.5    49.1%     12.2   22.8 MB
    head-deberta int8       78.1      52.5    47.7%     38.2   82.3 MB

A tie on the deciding axis, better on dialogue_act, worse on legacy intent,
three times slower and three and a half times larger. It loses on the latency
budget, which is a real reason.

Worth recording that it was ahead before quantization, 79.7 against 78.2, and
int8 cost it 1.6 points where it cost MiniLM almost nothing. A larger encoder
had more to lose. If the latency budget were ever raised past 40ms this is the
candidate to revisit, and the fp32 number is the one to revisit it with.

## Why not head-tiny

Half the latency, 6.2 ms against 12.2 ms, and 4.3 points worse on
needs_response. Both are far inside the budget, and the budget is not the
binding constraint at this end of the range. Accuracy on the deciding axis is.

If a slower hardware cell later makes 12.2 ms tight, head-tiny is the fallback
and the gap is known.

## dialogue_act, reported and not gated

51.4, and the number should not be read against the committed 0.80 without its
context. The axis has five classes and one of them, `interruption`, has 31 rows
in the whole corpus and 5 in the held out split. Macro F1 averages classes
equally, so a class that thin caps the axis regardless of the model. The report
names it and gives the average over adequately supported labels alongside.

## What was wrong with the first run of this table

Production first scored 10.1 on legacy_intent, and that number was wrong.

Tier 3 selects interviewer lines by matching `[INTERVIEWER`. The corpus marks
the other party `[SYSTEM]`, so the filter matched nothing, the last interviewer
line was empty, and the guard `''.length < 50` was trivially true. Combined with
passing the history length as the assistant message count, which clears the
`>= 2` gate, every tier 3 row returned `follow_up`.

The symptom was visible in the confusion table: production predicted `follow_up`
for 59 percent of rows labelled `general`, on a corpus where follow_up is 0.2
percent of real traffic. That is not a classifier being wrong, it is a harness
feeding it a format it cannot read.

After the fix production predicts `general` 54.3 percent against a corpus that
is 53 percent general, and `follow_up` 0.4 percent against a measured prior of
0.2 percent. The baseline is credible, and it is the more favourable of the two
readings, so the comparison is conservative.

## The cold start defect, found and fixed

The corpus had history on every row and production's first turn has none, so the
model was operating out of distribution exactly when a session starts.

Measured on the model above, needs_response macro F1 fell from 78.5 to 68.3 when
history was stripped from the held out split. A quarter of the training rows
then got a history stripped copy and a tenth got a single prior turn copy,
labels unchanged, each staying in its source's split. The model was retrained
and both models were scored on the SAME held out rows, taken from the preserved
pre augmentation corpus so that neither model is tested on rows built from its
own training distribution.

    model                  with history   cold start    gap
    before augmentation        78.5          68.3      10.3
    after augmentation         78.8          78.0       0.7

The cold start case gained 9.8 points and the warm case gained 0.3. The gap
closed from 10.3 points to 0.7. The augmentation did not buy cold start accuracy
by trading away the warm case, which is the usual outcome and the thing the two
by two table exists to catch.

The shipped model is the augmented one. On the augmented held out split, which
now contains both warm and cold turns as production does, it scores 78.2 on
needs_response against production's 0.0 and an always guessing floor of 36.0,
and 38.7 on legacy_intent against production's 15.2.

## Not measured

Nothing ran on Windows. Every number here is Apple Silicon. The acceptance bar
names an Intel Mac, a separate and slower cell that has not been run.
