## Reranker benchmark — every model against a no-reranker baseline

Measured 2026-09-04 on macOS arm64. Forty passages across eight topics; each
topic contributes ONE passage that answers its question and FOUR that discuss
the same subject in the same vocabulary without answering it. A bi-encoder
scores all five alike, so separating them is exactly the work a reranker does.
Twenty-four queries (three phrasings per topic: plain, keyword-shifted toward a
distractor, and deliberately vague).

Every reranker sees the IDENTICAL frozen candidate list — the whole 40-passage
pool in retrieval order — so the only thing varying between rows is the
reranker. MRR is reported alongside top-1 because the baseline is already
strong and top-1 alone has too little resolution near the ceiling. `+/-` counts
queries where the gold passage moved up / moved down against the baseline: a
model can gain top-1 while making other queries worse, and that shows here.

**Baseline (no reranker at all)** — `openai/text-embedding-3-small` @ 1536:
top-1 **18/24**, top-3 22/24, mean rank 0.583, **MRR 0.8368**

Not measured: the four **Jina hosted** models — no `JINA_API_KEY` exists in
`.env` or in the app's credential store, so they were skipped rather than
guessed at. The **Ettin extension** refuses at init by design; Core runs all
three Ettin sizes itself and they appear above.

### The bundled default is the worst thing in this table

`Xenova/bge-reranker-base` ships with the app and is what an empty selection
resolves to, so it is the reranker most users actually have. It scores **MRR
0.7558 against a 0.8368 baseline** — ΔMRR **−0.0810**, ten times worse than the
next-worst model, moving 7 queries down against 3 up, and on one query taking
the answer from rank 2 to rank **17**.

It is not broken. It loads, scores all 24 queries, and ranks an obvious probe
perfectly (Paris 8.787 / Rhine −3.038 / photosynthesis −10.181). It is simply a
2022-era cross-encoder meeting same-vocabulary distractors, and losing.

**Acted on — it was replaced, not just removed.**

`Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` is the bundled default as of 2026-09-04:

| | MRR | ΔMRR | +/− | ms | installer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| was `bge-reranker-base` | 0.7558 | **−0.0810** | +3/−7 | 1873 | 283 MB |
| now `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` | 0.8688 | **+0.0320** | +4/−2 | 211 | **24 MB** |

A twelfth of the size, nine times faster, and it improves the ranking instead of
degrading it — verified by re-running the sweep against the bundled copy, which
scores identically to the catalogue entry (19/24, MRR 0.8688, 222 ms).

Because the default now helps, the low-confidence escalation is back and earns
its place: a chosen reranker runs on every permitted query, the bundled one only
when retrieval is unsure. It is still an escalation rather than unconditional —
+0.0320 is real but modest, and a default install should not pay for it on every
query.

`bge-reranker-base` stays reachable for anyone who wants it: it remains in the
catalogue and `rerankerDownloadProvider` fetches it on demand. Its weights are
simply no longer preinstalled.

### What the numbers say

- **Every reranker except one beat doing nothing.** `ettin-reranker-32m` is the
  exception at ΔMRR −0.0069: it moved 3 queries up and 5 down. The smallest
  model in the catalogue is not worth its 132 MB here.
- **Hosted wins on both quality and latency.** `cohere/rerank-4-pro` was perfect
  (24/24, MRR 1.0) at 824 ms for a 40-passage pool, and three more hosted models
  cleared MRR 0.96 at ~500 ms. Local models pay 2-6 s for less.
- **`jina-reranker-v3.5` is the best local model** (22/24, MRR 0.9514) and it
  never made a query worse (+5/−0). It costs 2 s and 410 MB.
- **Bigger is not better.** `bge-reranker-large` (580 MB, 6 s) scored ΔMRR
  +0.0101 — below `ms-marco-minilm-l6` at 24 MB and 211 ms.
- **Core and the extensions agree exactly.** `jina-reranker-v3.5` scored
  identically through Core's in-process llama.cpp and through the extension's
  `llama-server` path — same rank on all 24 queries — and so did Qwen3. Two
  independent implementations of each protocol producing identical rankings is
  the strongest correctness evidence in this table.
- **`nvidia/llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2:free` returned null twice** out of 24
  with no error. Its MRR is computed over the 22 it answered, so the row is not
  comparable with the rest; the seam would keep the existing order on those two.
