# Baseline sweep — every reranker against *no* reranker

A second corpus and a different question from the harness one directory up.

`../run.mjs` compares reranker candidates on a fixture corpus of resumes and
JDs. This one asks a narrower thing: **does each reranker beat doing nothing,
and by how much** — across every route the app can take, including the ones the
sibling harness does not reach (local GGUF, and installed extensions).

## Why a separate corpus

Forty passages across eight topics. Each topic contributes ONE passage that
answers its question and FOUR that discuss the same subject in the same
vocabulary without answering it. A bi-encoder scores all five alike, so
separating them is exactly the work a reranker does — and it is the only way to
leave headroom above a strong embedder. An earlier attempt with topically
distinct passages had the embedder at 18/24 top-1 before any reranker ran, and
the differences between models vanished into noise.

Three phrasings per topic: plain, keyword-shifted toward a distractor, and
deliberately vague.

## Running it

```bash
npm run build:electron          # the sweep loads the built ports, not the sources
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...   # baseline embedder + the OpenRouter rows
export JINA_API_KEY=...         # optional; without it the Jina rows skip

node benchmarks/reranker-eval/baseline-sweep/build-corpus.mjs corpus.json   # regenerate (already committed)
node benchmarks/reranker-eval/baseline-sweep/baseline.mjs corpus.json baseline.json

# then one row at a time — a fresh process each, because llama.cpp and ONNX
# each hold hundreds of MB and one process sweeping ten models measures memory
# pressure rather than reranking
node benchmarks/reranker-eval/baseline-sweep/run-one.mjs builtin Xenova/bge-reranker-base baseline.json out/x.json
node benchmarks/reranker-eval/baseline-sweep/run-one.mjs onnx  ms-marco-minilm-l6      baseline.json out/x.json
node benchmarks/reranker-eval/baseline-sweep/run-one.mjs gguf  jina-reranker-v3.5-q4km baseline.json out/x.json
node benchmarks/reranker-eval/baseline-sweep/run-one.mjs openrouter cohere/rerank-4-pro baseline.json out/x.json
node benchmarks/reranker-eval/baseline-sweep/run-one.mjs jina   jina-reranker-v3.5      baseline.json out/x.json
node benchmarks/reranker-eval/baseline-sweep/run-one.mjs extension natively-jina-reranker baseline.json out/x.json
```

`baseline.json` freezes the embedded candidate list, so every reranker sees the
IDENTICAL pool and a re-run costs no embedding spend. Regenerate it only when
the corpus changes.

`builtin` is the BUNDLED cross-encoder — not a catalogue entry, needs no
download, and is what an empty selection resolves to. Sweeping only the
catalogue leaves out the reranker most users actually run, which is how it went
unmeasured until someone asked whether every local model had been tried.

Local rows need the model installed (Settings → Reranker, or
`localModelInstaller.installCatalogModel`). Extension rows load the extension's
own `dist/` build from `~/natively-extensions/`.

## Reading the output

- **MRR** over ALL queries, not just answered ones — a model that returns null
  half the time must not outscore one that answers badly.
- **`+n/-n`** counts queries where the gold passage moved up / moved down
  against the baseline. A model can gain top-1 while regressing others, and
  that is what caught the broken extensions.
- **`failed`** counts null or incomplete returns. The seam rejects a partial
  ranking wholesale and keeps the existing order, so those look like success
  from outside — which is the whole reason this column exists.

## Results

the `recommended` flags in `electron/rag/rerankerModelCatalog.ts`.
