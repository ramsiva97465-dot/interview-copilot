// Decides WHAT a turn is asking and WHETHER retrieval should run at all.
//
// WHY THIS LIVES ABOVE RETRIEVAL
// Phase 2 measured that every retrieval configuration returns a ranked pool for
// EVERY question — including "What is idempotency?". The retriever has no notion
// of "should I run"; it always produces output. So the fast/grounded decision
// cannot live inside retrieval and must be made here, before it.
//
// DETERMINISTIC BY DESIGN
// §32.7 forbids using an LLM for deterministic policy decisions without evidence
// that it improves quality, and §22.6 forbids an expensive multi-agent router on
// every uncertain question. This classifier is pure, synchronous and testable —
// which also means a misclassification is reproducible rather than stochastic.

// Second person addressed to the candidate ("your project"), or explicit
// self-reference. These are the questions that REQUIRE private evidence.
// Covers SECOND person ("your project") and THIRD person ("the candidate's
// project"). Interview-prep and recruiting surfaces routinely phrase questions
// in the third person, and a second-person-only pattern silently classified
// "What is the name of the price-comparison website the candidate built?" as
// requiring no source at all.
// `yourself` (2026-08-02): a second-person REFLEXIVE marks the addressee as the
// object of the predicate — "introduce yourself", "present yourself", "describe
// yourself" are self-presentation requests about the USER's person, the same
// class as "tell me about yourself". The list previously carried only that one
// literal phrase, so every other imperative of the class produced zero claims;
// the general-knowledge last resort then routed "introduce yourself" FAST and
// the model INVENTED a persona from the conversation topic (live log,
// 2026-08-02: a GraphQL chat produced "I'm a backend engineer…" from nothing).
// Emphatic uses ("did you build it yourself?") are questions about the user's
// own work, so the personal claim is correct for them too.
// `candidate` narrowed 2026-08-28 (T2). It used to appear here as
// `the candidate|candidate'?s?` — matching the bare noun — which made every
// ordinary ML / search / database use of the word an IDENTITY question with
// retrieve=false: "candidate generation", "candidate set size", "candidate
// key". Candidate generation is a stock system-design interview topic, so the
// token was breaking technical-interview on its own bread-and-butter material.
//
// The discriminator is GRAMMATICAL, not lexical. In the technical sense
// `candidate` is a MODIFIER — it is followed by the noun it modifies
// ("candidate pool", "candidate key"). In the person sense it is the HEAD of
// the noun phrase, so what follows it is a verb, a preposition, punctuation or
// nothing at all.
//
// Two conditions, and the FIRST is what does most of the work:
//
//   1. a DETERMINER is required. The technical compound almost never carries
//      one ("candidate generation", "candidate sampling"), and the sweep's
//      product-name shape ("How does Candidate handle failures?") carries none
//      either. `a` is deliberately excluded — "what is a candidate key?" is a
//      database question.
//   2. the next word must not be a technical HEAD noun, which catches the
//      determined compounds "the candidate pool", "the Candidate project".
//
// Rule 2 is a blocklist and blocklists are open-ended — "candidate span",
// "candidate edge", "candidate passage" are all real and a miss here makes a
// technical turn personal again. A whitelist of what may follow the person
// sense was tried first and is strictly worse: the person sense is most often
// followed by an ORDINARY VERB ("has the candidate shipped anything at
// scale?"), and open-class verbs cannot be enumerated either — but getting one
// wrong there silently drops a real recruiting question, which is the more
// damaging direction. So the blocklist stands, and the sweep over 106 product
// terms is what keeps it honest.
// `id`/`ids` are deliberately ABSENT from this list: "the decoy candidate ID"
// is a recruiting field, not an ML term, and the isolation probe in
// RemainingDefects2026_08_01 depends on it staying personal.

// used to be a second copy of CLAIM_AUTHORITY's authoritative lists, and the
// comment above records the drift incident that duplication caused — a source
// added to one map and not the other made a claim silently unreachable
// (Recruiting/CANDIDATE_FILE, twice). One table now answers both questions.
