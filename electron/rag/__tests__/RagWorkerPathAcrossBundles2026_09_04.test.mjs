/**
 * The rerank workers must be findable from EVERY bundle that inlines them.
 *
 * The bug this exists for: `GgufReranker` and `LocalReranker` each resolved
 * their worker with three fixed candidates —
 *
 *     <__dirname>/<worker>.js
 *     <__dirname>/rag/<worker>.js
 *     <__dirname>/electron/rag/<worker>.js
 *
 * — which covers `electron/rag/` and `electron/` and nothing else. esbuild
 * builds one bundle per entry point and INLINES every module it imports, so
 * both classes exist in ~30 output files at four different depths, and
 * `__dirname` is the executing bundle's directory rather than the source file's.
 * The rerank seam lives under `services/`, where none of the three resolved.
 *
 * What that looked like in production: `buildLocalGgufPort()` returned a port,
 * the port spawned a Worker on a path that does not exist, `rerank()` caught the
 * error and returned null, and the seam read null as "keep the existing order".
 * All three GGUF rerankers scored nothing, with no error anywhere. MEASURED
 * before the fix: 0 of 10 benchmark queries produced a ranking; after: 8-9 of 10
 * had the known-correct passage first.
 *
 * These assertions are on the RESOLVER, driven by a simulated dist layout, so
 * they hold without building 30 bundles — and they fail if anyone reintroduces
 * depth guessing.
 *
 * Run: `node --test electron/rag/__tests__/RagWorkerPathAcrossBundles2026_09_04.test.mjs`
