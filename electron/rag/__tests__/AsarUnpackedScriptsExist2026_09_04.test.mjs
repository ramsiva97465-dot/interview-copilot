/**
 * Rewriting a path to `app.asar.unpacked` and actually unpacking the file are
 * ONE decision. This pins them together.
 *
 * THE BUG. `resolveBundledScript` rewrote every resolved path from `app.asar`
 * to `app.asar.unpacked`, unconditionally. That is only correct for a file
 * `build.asarUnpack` was told to copy out. `fs.existsSync` returns true for a
 * path inside the archive — Electron patches fs so the asar looks like a
 * directory — so a candidate always "exists", the rewrite always fires, and for
 * any script NOT in asarUnpack the result is a path electron-builder never
 * wrote. The extension host bootstrap was exactly that: the dev-mode fix landed,
 * and packaged builds would have failed to fork it, silently, with every
 * extension dying at startup for the second time in one day.
 *
 * Nothing caught it because both path tests run against the unpacked
 * `dist-electron` tree, where no path contains `app.asar` and the rewrite never
 * fires. The rule cannot be checked by resolving; it has to be checked against
 * the packaging config.
 *
 * Run: `node --test electron/rag/__tests__/AsarUnpackedScriptsExist2026_09_04.test.mjs`
