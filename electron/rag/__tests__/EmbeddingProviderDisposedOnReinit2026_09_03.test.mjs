// Regression test for: re-initializing the embedding pipeline abandoned a
// loaded local model.
//
// THE BUG. LocalEmbeddingProvider spawns a worker that loads the bundled MiniLM
// ONNX model, and the class had NO teardown at all — only `worker.unref?.()`,
// which lets the process exit but frees nothing. Meanwhile
// EmbeddingPipeline._doInitialize() runs again on every embedding-related
// config change and opens with:
//
//     this.fallbackProvider = new LocalEmbeddingProvider();
//
// overwriting the field. The instance being replaced kept its worker — and its
// loaded model — alive for the rest of the session, referenced by nothing.
//
// The trigger is ordinary: changing an embedding API key, model or provider in
// Settings re-initializes the pipeline.
//
// PLATFORM. This matters far more on Windows than on the machine it was found
// on. On macOS the Gemini embedding path usually wins, so the local model never
// loads; on Windows the Gemini embedding key returns 403 and the resolver
// demotes to this bundled local model — so the abandoned copy is real there.
// Requires physical Windows verification.
//
// THE FIX, guarded here: LocalEmbeddingProvider.dispose() terminates the worker
// and rejects anything in flight, and the pipeline disposes the outgoing local
// providers before replacing them — deduped by identity, because `provider` and
// `fallbackProvider` are deliberately the same object in local-only mode.
