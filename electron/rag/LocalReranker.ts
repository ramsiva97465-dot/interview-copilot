//
// Phase 1 (smart-retrieval rollout) — LOCAL cross-encoder reranker.
//
// A cross-encoder scores (query, passage) JOINTLY and is far more accurate than
// the bi-encoder cosine fusion used on the hot path — at the cost of running one
// model pass per candidate. We run it ON-DEVICE via @huggingface/transformers
// (the SAME ONNX runtime already loaded for the MiniLM embedder), so the
// escalation costs $0, hits no API, and is
// immune to the Gemini 429s that are routine in this app.
//
// LOAD POSTURE:
//   • ESM-only package → forced runtime import() via `new Function` inside the
//     dedicated worker (see localRerankerWorker.ts for the why).
//   • Packaged prod: local_files_only, model read from resources/models. The
//     reranker model IS bundled (stale-comment fix 2026-08-13): download-models.js
//     fetches Xenova/bge-reranker-base (q8) at postinstall, extraResources maps
//     resources/models/ → models/, and verify-packaged-local-assets.mjs lists all
//     four reranker files in REQUIRED_MODEL_FILES — the build FAILS without them.
//     If the model is genuinely absent at runtime, load() fails and the caller
//     falls through to the existing top-K (graceful degradation, not the norm).
//   • Dev: allowRemoteModels so the model is fetched + cached on first use.
//
// WORKER-ISOLATED (2026-07-05 SIGTRAP crash hardening): the actual ONNX
// cross-encoder model/tokenizer load and inference (the forward pass in
// rerank()) now run inside a dedicated worker_threads.Worker, NOT on the
// Electron main thread — mirroring the isolation already applied to
// LocalEmbeddingProvider and Whisper's worker
// worker. See localEmbeddingWorker.ts for the full crash-forensics writeup:
// this file previously had the identical unsafe main-thread ONNX pattern,
// fixed now while the reranker is still inert rather than waiting for it to
// go live and hit the same crash.
//
// Everything here is best-effort: any failure (package missing, model absent,
// API shape mismatch) resolves to `null`, never throws, and the retriever keeps
// its current behavior. The Phase-1 flag (`ragLocalRerank`) gates whether this
// is consulted at all.
