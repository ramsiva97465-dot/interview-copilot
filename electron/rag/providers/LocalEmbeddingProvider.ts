// WHY WORKER-ISOLATED (2026-07-05): 9/9 real macOS crash reports
// (~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/Electron-*.ips) showed the app crashing
// on the MAIN THREAD inside ONNX Runtime's BFC allocator
// (BFCArena::Extend → posix_memalign) during a live InferenceSession::Run()
// call, with 16-17 ORT-related OS threads alive at crash time. This is
// consistent with multiple ONNX sessions (Whisper's streaming STT worker +
// the intent classifier's zero-shot worker, since removed + this local-embedding fallback) being
// concurrently active in-process. Both of those other consumers already ran
// their ONNX sessions inside a worker_threads.Worker; this provider was the
// ONLY one still calling pipeline()/embed() directly on the main process. It
// is now isolated the same way, following the exact message-passing pattern
// the (since removed) intent classifier used.
//
// Public API (isAvailable/embed/embedQuery/embedBatch) is UNCHANGED — all
// worker plumbing is internal so EmbeddingPipeline.ts and
// EmbeddingProviderResolver.ts require no changes.
