// Shared width-resize easing for the overlay shell.
//
// HISTORICAL "SYNC CONTRACT" (now superseded — kept for context):
// There USED to be a hard contract that the renderer (CSS width on the React
// shell) and the main process (native window width setBounds) trace the SAME
// width over the SAME wall-clock duration, each running its own clock and
// computing width(t) from THIS module, so the CSS layer and the OS window
// landed on every keyframe together. That mattered when the OS window itself
// width-resized in lockstep with the shell.
//
// THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE. The OS overlay window is now a FIXED WIDTH (780) for
// its entire visible lifetime; only the panel animates 600↔780 centered inside
// it (see WindowHelper.setOverlayDimensionsCentered + the startTransition in
// MeetFlooInterface). The main process never animates width and never imports
// this module's width sampler — grep WindowHelper.ts: no widthAt /
// easeOverlayResize / resize loop. So the width channel is now PURELY
// renderer-side, and nothing downstream consumes an in-between width. That
// freedom is why the renderer can use a velocity-continuous SPRING for the
// width motion value (see OVERLAY_RESIZE_SPRING): an interrupted/retargeted
// scroll-driven transition no longer restarts a bezier from zero velocity (the
// old hitch), and any spring micro-overshoot stays entirely renderer-side — it
// can NOT reach a native width setBounds, because there is no native one.
//
// HOW THE RENDERER ANIMATES IT: the OVERLAY_RESIZE_SPRING drives a `shellWidth`
// MOTION VALUE that is bound directly to the panel's CSS `width`. The content
// reflows (text re-wrap + code re-layout) to the real panel width on every
// frame, so the layout is correct at every in-between width — there is NO
// clipping, scaleX, or transform that would distort the content. The per-frame
// reflow cost is held down on the renderer side (`contain: layout style` scopes
// it to the shell subtree; syntax highlighting is memoized on code string +
// language so a width change re-wraps without re-tokenizing), NOT by faking the
// width. `shellWidth` is consumed by the CSS width, the resize-button anchor,
// the width-derived scroll-max, and the rate-limited height channel.
//
// The bezier (OVERLAY_RESIZE_EASE / easeOverlayResize / widthAt) is RETAINED:
//   • it documents the original curve intent,
//   • the pure samplers remain unit-tested,
//   • a future consumer that needs a deterministic non-spring width(t) (e.g. a
//     reduced-motion fallback, or a re-introduced native width loop) can use it.
//
// Pure, dependency-free, importable from:
//   • renderer  (src/components/MeetFlooInterface.tsx)
//   • node test (electron/utils/__tests__/overlayResizeEasing.test.mjs)
//
// MONOTONIC BY CONSTRUCTION: easeOverlayResize / easeOutQuint are strictly
// non-overshooting — relevant for any pure deterministic consumer. The live
// width spring is allowed a tiny overshoot precisely because it is renderer-
// only (CSS width) and never pushed to a native setBounds.

 *
 * WHY A SPRING (not the bezier tween it replaces for the live channel):
 * the scroll scanner re-triggers a transition whenever a code block crosses the
 * viewport edge. A duration+bezier RESTARTS from progress 0 at the current
 * width on every re-trigger, so a fast scroll through mixed code/text produced a
 * velocity discontinuity each time (decelerating tail → abrupt fast restart) —
 * the "stutter". framer retargets a spring IN-FLIGHT, carrying the current
 * velocity into the new target, so consecutive expand/contract scans blend into
 * one continuous motion instead of a stack of restarts.
 *
 * Tuning: visualDuration ≈ the old 420ms perceived settle so the feel matches
 * the established drawer timing; bounce 0 = critically-damped, NO overshoot at
 * the resting target for an uninterrupted run (reads as a weighted pane settling
 * exactly like the bezier did). The only time the spring can momentarily pass
 * the target is during an interruption, and that excursion is renderer-only
 * (fixed-width window → never reaches a native width setBounds), so it is safe.
 *
 * NOTE: the renderer (TS) consumes this via the hand-maintained sibling
 * overlayResizeEasing.d.mts, which types `type` as the literal "spring" so it
 * matches framer-motion's discriminated transition-options union. Keep that
 * declaration in sync if this shape changes.

/**
 * CARD-RESIZE TWEEN — the transitions.dev "Card resize" motion signature
 * (`--resize-dur: 300ms`, `--resize-ease: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`),
 * adopted 2026-09-13 for the overlay's HEIGHT axis only.
 *
 * THE TWO AXES CARRY DIFFERENT CURVES, chosen by watching the candidates play in
 * the real overlay: the WIDTH keeps OVERLAY_RESIZE_SPRING (it was briefly moved
 * to this tween and moved back), and this drives the chat viewport's height,
 * which did not animate at all before — it cut. They never run at the same time:
 * while the width animates, the height SNAPS to whatever the re-wrapped content
 * implies, so the axes stay in lockstep (see decideHeightCommit's
 * `widthAnimating` branch; without it the width visibly leads the height).
 *
 * WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT A `.t-resize` CLASS. The snippet is written for a box
 * whose width/height are set by CSS, so a `transition:` can own them. Neither
 * axis of this overlay is:
 *   • WIDTH is written every frame by a framer MotionValue bound to
 *     `style.width` — a CSS transition on a JS-driven property is inert,
 *     because each write restarts it from the value just written.
 *   • HEIGHT is the shell card's auto height, and the card is `overflow-hidden`
 *     with the footer at the bottom of a flex column — tweening the CARD would
 *     slice the footer off for the whole 300ms (see the
 *     STREAMING_HEIGHT_GROW_BUFFER_PX comment in MeetFlooInterface.tsx).
 * So the SIGNATURE is adopted in a JS channel instead: an animated-height
 * wrapper around the chat viewport — the card's only elastic element — carries
 * this curve. (The width bullet above is why a CSS transition could not have
 * driven that axis either, back when it was a candidate for this curve.)
 *
 * THE CURVE vs THE DRAWER BEZIER. Both are easeOutQuint-shaped — a hard
 * departure into a near-flat tail — but sampled against each other the card
 * curve is ahead at every point, and overwhelmingly so at the start: at a tenth
 * of the way through it has covered 40% of the travel where OVERLAY_RESIZE_EASE
 * has covered 27%. They converge by the quarter mark (0.765 vs 0.779) and the
 * card curve finishes marginally ahead again. Stack the shorter duration on top
 * of that earlier departure and the two effects compound: 30ms after a resize
 * begins the panel is 40% of the way there, against ~19% before.
 *
 * Monotonic, no overshoot — safe for any channel that reaches a native
 * setBounds (an overshoot there would be a window edge briefly past its target).
