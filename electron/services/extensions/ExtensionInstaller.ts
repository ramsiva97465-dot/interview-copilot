/**
 * Getting an extension's payload onto disk, and browsing what exists.
 *
 * `ExtensionManager.install()` deliberately does not fetch anything — by the
 * time it is called the bytes are already staged and it decides only whether
 * they may be recorded. This file is the other half: it stages them.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It installs from a LOCAL DIRECTORY. It does not download and execute a
 * payload from the internet. That is a deliberate line, not an oversight:
 *
 *   - An extension's entrypoint is real code that runs on the user's machine.
 *     The sandbox is defence in depth against a SLOPPY extension, and
 *     `docs/extensions.md` is explicit that it is not a boundary against a
 *     hostile one — a native addon does its I/O from C++ and never passes a
 *     patched `require`, and `process.spawn` runs a real binary outside the
 *     broker's reach.
 *   - So fetching arbitrary code from a URL and running it is a materially
 *     different risk from downloading MODEL WEIGHTS, which are data checked
 *     against a recorded sha256.
 *
 * The remote registry below is therefore METADATA ONLY: it tells the user what
 * extensions exist and where their repositories are. Obtaining the payload is
 * the user's explicit act. Remote payload installation, if it is ever added,
 * needs signature verification rather than just a host allowlist.

 * worse than a large one. The size ceiling below is what bounds this instead.
