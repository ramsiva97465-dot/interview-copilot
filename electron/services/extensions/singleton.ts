/**
 * Process-wide singletons that survive this repo's bundling.
 *
 * `scripts/build-electron.js` makes EVERY TypeScript file under `electron/`
 * its own esbuild entry point with `bundle: true`. A module imported by three
 * entry points is therefore inlined three times, and its module-level state
 * exists three times over. A plain `let instance` / `getInstance()` singleton
 * would silently become several instances — which, for the extension registry
 * and the licence ledger, means permission and acknowledgement checks answered
 * from the wrong state.
 *
 * Anchoring on `globalThis` gives one instance per PROCESS regardless of how
 * many bundles inlined this file. Same approach as the context-debug registry.
