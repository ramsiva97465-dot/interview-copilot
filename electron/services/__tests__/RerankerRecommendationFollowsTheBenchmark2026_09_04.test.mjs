/**
 * What the catalogue RECOMMENDS has to follow what was measured.
 *
 * The catalogue recommended `bge-reranker-v2-m3-q4km` and nothing else. Against
 * a no-reranker baseline over 24 queries on a 40-passage pool with same-topic
 * distractors (docs/reranker-benchmark-2026-09-04.md) it scored MRR 0.8618
 * against the baseline's 0.8368 — the second-weakest working model in the
 * catalogue, and it moved three queries DOWN. It was chosen before any
 * benchmark existed, which is exactly what the architecture doc's rule
 * ("promotion to recommended requires a benchmark run") is meant to prevent.
 *
 * These assertions pin the OUTCOME of that run, so a future edit that promotes
 * a model on vibes has to delete a test that names numbers.
 *
 * Run: `node --test electron/services/__tests__/RerankerRecommendationFollowsTheBenchmark2026_09_04.test.mjs`
