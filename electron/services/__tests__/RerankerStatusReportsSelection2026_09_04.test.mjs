/**
 * The Reranker panel must name the model that will actually run.
 *
 * `reranker:get-status` computed `effective` for the local branch as
 * `{ kind: 'local', id: builtIn.id }`, and `builtIn` is the hardcoded bundled
 * model. `localModelId` never entered the calculation, so selecting any
 * catalogue model — Jina v3.5, ms-marco, bge-large — left the panel saying
 * "BGE Reranker Base" while the seam ran something else. Its own comment
 * claimed the opposite: "resolved the same way the retrieval path resolves it —
 * so the panel cannot disagree with reality".
 *
 * Observed against the running app before the fix: `effective` stayed
 * `local:bge-reranker-base` across an ONNX selection and a GGUF selection.
 *
 * The resolution rule is asserted here rather than the IPC handler, because the
 * handler needs Electron's `app`. The rule is the part that was wrong.
 *
 * Run: `node --test electron/services/__tests__/RerankerStatusReportsSelection2026_09_04.test.mjs`
