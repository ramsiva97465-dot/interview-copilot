// Regression test for: the dev launcher load-retry loop never terminated.
//
// THE BUG. WindowHelper.createWindow() self-heals a failed dev load (the Vite
// server at http://127.0.0.1:5180 being momentarily down) by re-issuing
// loadURL() once a second, bounded by MAX_LAUNCHER_LOAD_RETRIES = 10. The bound
// was unreachable. The counter was reset inside the `did-finish-load` handler —
// but when a load fails, Chromium commits its OWN error page, and that error
// page fires `did-finish-load` like any other document. So every failure ran:
//
//     did-fail-load -> launcherLoadRetries = 1 -> schedule retry
//     (error page commits) -> did-finish-load -> launcherLoadRetries = 0
//
// and the counter never passed 1. The result was an unbounded 1 Hz navigation
// loop for as long as the dev server stayed down.
//
// MEASURED on macOS (Electron 43.1.0), `electron .` with port 5180 closed:
//
//   BEFORE: 39 retries in a 40s run, every one logged "(1/10)". A prior session
//           log (natively_debug.prev.log, 2026-08-15 11:07->11:36) shows the
//           same loop running 1447 times across 29 minutes, all "(1/10)".
//   AFTER:  exactly 10 retries in the same 40s window, logged "(1/10)" through
//           "(10/10)", then silence.
//
// THE FIX, guarded here: the budget is reset from the `loadURL()` promise's
// resolution — the only signal that distinguishes a real load from a committed
// error page, because loadURL() REJECTS on a failed load — and the
// `did-finish-load` handler no longer touches the counter.
//
// STRATEGY. Source-level static check, same as the neighbouring
// LauncherBootRevealNotFrameGated2026_09_01 / OverlayContentProtectionFollowsUndetectable
// tests: WindowHelper.ts instantiates BrowserWindow on import and pulls in
// main-process-only Electron APIs, so the handler cannot be exercised in
// isolation without standing up a real app.
//
// The assertion is scoped to the extracted `did-finish-load` handler body
// rather than run against the whole file, because `launcherLoadRetries = 0`
// legitimately appears elsewhere (in the loadLauncher success path). A
// whole-source check could not tell the two apart. A mutation probe below
// re-inserts the reset into the handler and asserts the guard catches it.
