/**
 * The model you select is the model that runs — for both embedding and rerank.
 *
 * Two separate failures sat behind this, and neither produced an error:
 *
 *  1. A chosen RERANKER barely ran. The seam treats reranking as a
 *     low-confidence escalation, so it only fired when `computeConfidence()`
 *     tripped. Measured against the running app over 36 doc-grounded
 *     retrievals across 9 queries: it tripped ONCE. A downloaded, selected,
 *     successfully-tested reranker did nothing on 35 of 36 queries.
 *
 *  2. A chosen local reranker was not even NAMED correctly — see
 *     RerankerStatusReportsSelection2026_09_04.
 *
 * The embedding side was already correct, and is pinned here too so it stays
 * that way: a manual choice filters the candidate chain to that provider, and
 * the chosen model AND its measured width reach the provider's constructor.
 * Getting the width wrong does not throw — it writes vectors under a space key
 * they do not belong to, and the index silently stops matching.
 *
 * Run: `node --test electron/services/__tests__/ActiveModelIsTheOneUsed2026_09_04.test.mjs`
