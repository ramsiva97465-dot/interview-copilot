/**
 * The rerank seam must honour a port's declared batch size.
 *
 * `ModeHybridRetriever` splits its 30-candidate pool into batches of 6. That is
 * an ONNX arena-memory measure (see RERANK_BATCH_SIZE's own comment) and is
 * correct for the built-in cross-encoder. It is wrong for any port whose cost is
 * a round trip rather than a forward pass: five sequential HTTP calls instead of
 * one is ~5x the latency and ~5x the spend, which is enough to push a hosted
 * model that comfortably clears RERANK_BUDGET_MS (1200ms) past it.
 *
 * These are source guards because `maybeRerankCandidates` is private and sits
 * behind a mode-index/DB stack that this test has no business standing up. The
 * behavioural half is covered by the batching arithmetic asserted below.
