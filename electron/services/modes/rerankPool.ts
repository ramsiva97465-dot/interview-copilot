// Which candidates the cross-encoder gets to see.
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-07 (General mode, six attached files, one of them 420 KB of
// 600 near-identical padding records; Voyage rerank-2.5-lite, pool 30): for
// "find every place a latency number appears", the hybrid lexical+vector
// pre-rank put THIRTY padding chunks above every chunk of the five small files
// — the padding all says "latency budget" and "metrics". The reranker never
// saw the résumé metrics, the anchor sheet or the PERFORMANCE-301 numbers; they
// reached the answer only through the per-file selection floor, unreranked and
// sorted last. A reranker can only fix an ordering it is shown.
//
// So the pool is built with a per-file floor BEFORE the global fill: every
// attached file gets its best `perFileFloor` chunks into the pool, then the
// remaining slots fill by hybrid order. The pool SIZE is unchanged (cost is
// the same); only its composition is. For an exhaustive request the floor is
// balanced across files; for an ordinary turn it is one chunk per file, so a
// single-topic question in a many-file mode still spends most of its pool on
// the file that dominates.

// This lived in ModeHybridRetriever beside the resolver, which meant the UI had
// no way to read it and carried a literal `15` instead — while an untouched
// install actually reranked 30. Settings > Reranker therefore displayed a
// number retrieval never used, and every selectable value LOWERED the pool
// below the default. One exported constant removes that drift class: the
// retriever clamps to it, the IPC status reports it, and the UI renders what
// the status reports.
//
// The value itself is not a preference. It is bounded by the ONNX arena and the
// rerank latency budget (see RERANK_BATCH_SIZE's crash forensics in
// ModeHybridRetriever), so a user may narrow the pool but never widen it.
