// electron/llm/streamFallbackEngine.ts
//
// Pure, dependency-free core of a streaming provider-fallback chain. Provider-
// neutral: a "provider" is just `{ id, name, priority, open(signal, attempt) }`,
// so any caller can build its own concrete provider list (each `open()` wraps
// a real streaming SDK call) and its own config/health map, then delegate the
// orchestration to runStreamingFallback() here. `visionStreamFallback.ts` is
// one binding of this engine — it re-exports these names under the vision-
// flavoured names LLMHelper already calls, with vision-tuned config defaults.
// `textStreamFallback.ts` is a second binding, for the text streaming path.
// Keeping the state machine free of SDK/Electron deps makes the fragile parts
// — the first-token "commit point", retry classification, circuit breaking,
// and speed reordering — unit testable with deterministic fake providers.
//
// The "commit point" pattern (LiteLLM / OpenRouter / Vercel AI SDK):
//   • Before the first content chunk is yielded, a provider error/timeout is
//     SILENT — the caller has seen nothing, so we fall back to the next
//     provider/attempt with no visible artifact.
//   • Once the first chunk is yielded we are COMMITTED to that provider; a
//     later failure cannot switch providers (that would duplicate output), so
//     we end the stream gracefully with whatever was already delivered.
