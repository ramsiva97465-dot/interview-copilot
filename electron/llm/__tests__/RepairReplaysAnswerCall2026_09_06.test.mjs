// electron/llm/__tests__/RepairReplaysAnswerCall2026_09_06.test.mjs
//
// A post-answer repair was dispatched as
//
//     streamChat(repairPrompt, undefined, undefined, undefined, true, true)
//
// while the answer that produced the text it was repairing had the transcript,
// the screenshot, the reference files, the realtime prompt, the mode prompt and
// the evidence pack. So the repair was asked to improve an answer whose evidence
// it could not see — on a screenshot turn it could not see the screen at all —
// and with skipModeInjection still true it could not pull any of it back. It was
// reasoning from the prior answer's text alone.
//
// WhatToAnswerLLM already composes the answer as one argument tuple with
// ignoreKnowledgeMode and skipModeInjection BOTH true, which means everything is
// already inside that tuple's message and system prompt rather than injected
// downstream. So the tuple is self-contained: remembering it and replaying it
// gives a repair the same turn at no retrieval cost.
//
// Verified on the wire in scratchpad/repro-repair-wire.js — a real dist-electron
// bundle against a local HTTP server, inspecting the repair request's actual
// body. Before: only the repair instruction. After: transcript, reference text,
// realtime prompt, system prompt, repair instruction, and a base64 image
// payload. This file pins the semantics that probe cannot: the failure modes.
