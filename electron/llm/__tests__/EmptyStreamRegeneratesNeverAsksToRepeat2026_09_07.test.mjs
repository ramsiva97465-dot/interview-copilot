// Two engine-side producers of "can you repeat the question?" (2026-09-07).
//
// (1) buildGracefulRetry fired whenever a stream came back empty or a
//     non-provider error was swallowed, and its wording asked the user to
//     repeat. The engine now regenerates once first; the wording is honest.
// (2) The model itself sometimes answers a garbled fragment with ONLY
//     "Sorry, could you rephrase that? The audio cut out and I didn't catch the
//     question." — now a misfire on every answer type, which regenerates.
