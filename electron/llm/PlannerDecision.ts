// The eight-label classifier (ten regexes, then MobileBERT zero-shot in a worker,
// then a context heuristic) is removed. Measured on the real engine with Context
// Intelligence V3 default ON, its output reached ZERO dispatched prompts: the
// <intent_and_shape> block only ever entered the v2/v1 carriers, both discarded
// when V3 composes the turn. Its one surviving effect here, the planner gate
// below, passed on seven of eight labels and matched a hardcoded `general` on
// 98.3% of 1,011 held-out rows. So `general` is what it now returns, and the
// types stay only because three consumers still carry an IntentResult.
// docs/natively-router-final-answer-2026-09-05.md has the evidence.

// ── Question signal, for unpunctuated STT ───────────────────────────────────
//
// The local STT emits no punctuation, so `endsWith('?')` never fires live and the
// old single regex (WH-words plus a few "can you / tell me" forms) caught 38.0%
// of held-out turns that needed a response. What it missed was mostly auxiliary
// inversion with no question mark: "is that", "do you", "would it", "can we".
// Tuned on the TRAIN split of the router corpus against needs_response labels
// and reported on HOLDOUT: recall 38.0% -> 51.4%, false-positive 10.0% -> 14.0%.
// A tag-question rule ("... right", "... okay") was tried and dropped: two turns
// of recall for twenty-one backchannel false positives.
//
// This signal gates SPECULATION (IntelligenceEngine.maybeSpeculate), where a
// false positive costs one prefetch and a miss costs a slow answer to a real
// question. It does NOT gate whether to answer: 404 of the turns it still
// misses are labelled statements that need a response (a sales objection, a
// customer's complaint), which no question regex can see. That is the router's
// needs_response axis, and the planner below answers by default.
