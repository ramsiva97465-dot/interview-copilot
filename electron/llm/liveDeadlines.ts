 * caller passes llmHelper.isUsingOllama(). Checked FIRST, so a local rung is never

 *
 * `viaServerCascade`: llmHelper.isUsingNativelyServerCascade().

 * default-route behaviour.
 *
 * ALSO applied to the regen/repair streams. They originally passed hardcoded
 * 7000/8000 literals on every route, on the reasoning that they bound a
 * post-answer repair rather than the answer the user is waiting on — but a
 * repair window that expires before a slow gateway's first token is a repair
 * that can never land, so all eleven now go through repairDeadlineMs() (six in
 * IntelligenceEngine via repairFirstUsefulMs, five in ipcHandlers). Deliberately
 * NOT pinned to line numbers here: the previous version of this note cited
