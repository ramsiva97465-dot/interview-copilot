// never the reverse. liveDeadlines.ts imports exactly one type today and is
// consumed by the benchmark runners, which run outside Electron; making it
// depend on a persisted store would drag fs and the Electron app into every one
// of those. So the shipped route table stays where it is and stays pure, and
// the adaptive layer sits above it as a set of functions that take a profile as
// an argument.
//
// WHAT THIS LAYER MAY AND MAY NOT DO. It may only ever move a value INSIDE the
// range the shipped route table already considers sane (ROUTE_TTFT_BOUNDS), and
// on routes the table says are adaptive at all (TTFT_ADAPTIVE_ROUTES). With no
// evidence, every function here returns exactly what ships today — that is
// Phase 0 rule 20, enforced by construction rather than by care.
