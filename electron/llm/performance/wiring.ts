// WHY A HELPER AND NOT INLINE CODE. `raceStreamWithDeadline` has ~18 call sites
// across IntelligenceEngine, ipcHandlers and the phone-mirror path. Every fact
// this area has learned the hard way is about those sites drifting apart —
// liveDeadlines.ts documents a first-useful cap and a total ceiling that
// "disagreed about the same turn", a vision budget silently truncated at one
// surface but not another, and eleven repair sites that each carried their own
// literal. A call site that has to assemble an identity, look up a profile,
// derive a stall guard and build an observer will drift the same way. So it
// assembles none of that: it calls one function and spreads the result.
//
// EVERY PATH HERE IS FAIL-OPEN. Flags off, store unavailable, identity
// unresolvable — each returns the shipped constant and an undefined observer,
// which is byte-for-byte today's behaviour.
