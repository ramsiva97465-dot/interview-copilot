// Shipped priors — what Natively expects from a provider it has never measured.
//
// THE PRIOR IS THE CURRENT BEHAVIOUR, and that is the whole design. Phase 0
// rule 20 says "preserve current behavior as the fallback when calibration has
// insufficient confidence", and the cheapest way to guarantee that is to DERIVE
// each prior from the constant that governs today rather than to write a second
// set of numbers beside it. A prior that drifts from the shipped default is a
// silent behaviour change on every fresh install; a prior that is defined as the
// shipped default cannot drift.
//
// Phase 8 also says "do not hardcode fake precision. Use broad priors rather
// than misleading exact values." So there is exactly ONE knob per route, no
// per-model latency guesses, and no invented p50s. A model-family table of
// "expected TTFT" would be fabricated precision — we have no measurements for
// most of these, and the profile exists precisely to acquire them.
