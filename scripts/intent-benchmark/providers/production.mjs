//
// THE BASELINE THE CAMPAIGN IS ARGUING AGAINST: the shipped classifier, whole.
//
// The `rules` provider isolates tier 1. This one runs all three tiers by
// calling the real `classifyIntent` out of the compiled bundle, so the number
// it produces is what production does today, not a reconstruction of it:
//
//   tier 1  detectIntentByPattern, ten regex rules, first match wins
//   tier 2  MobileBERT zero-shot NLI in its own worker, gated on the turn being
//           longer than five characters and the top score reaching 0.35
//   tier 3  detectIntentByContext, a heuristic that cannot return null
//
// MobileBERT runs in the production worker, which is the architecture rule and
// also the only honest way to measure it: an in-process session would skip the
// round-trip production pays and flatter the baseline.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT DO IS THE MEASUREMENT.
//
// The pipeline resolves `legacy_intent` and the two axes that intent implies.
// It has no output for needs_response or dialogue_act. Not a weak output, no
// output: nothing in the ten rules, the eight NLI hypotheses or the context
// heuristic is about whether the assistant should speak. Those axes come back
// null and are scored wrong, and that is the finding rather than a handicap.
//
// So a candidate beating this on needs_response is not evidence of much. The
// `majority` provider is the honest floor for that axis.
