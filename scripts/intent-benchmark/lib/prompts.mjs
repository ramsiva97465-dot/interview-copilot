// A cloud LLM asked for "transcript lines" reliably produces clean prose with
// the capitals stripped. That is not what Natively's classifier sees. If the
// corpus is clean prose in disguise, every candidate is scored on an input
// distribution that does not exist in production, and the winner is whichever

// the noise instruction is specific, exemplified, and checked by
// lib/sttRealism.mjs before a batch is accepted.

const STT_RULES = `
HOW THE \`input\` FIELD MUST LOOK

\`input\` is raw output from a streaming speech-to-text model listening to a live
call. It is NOT written text. Natively's local models (Parakeet CTC, Whisper,
Moonshine) emit no punctuation and no capitalisation at all.

Every \`input\` MUST obey all of these:
- NO punctuation whatsoever. No full stops, no commas, no question marks, no
  apostrophes. "what's" becomes "whats". "i'm" becomes "im".
- NO capital letters anywhere, including names and the word "i".
- Real disfluency. Roughly a third of lines should carry a filler in a natural
  position: "um", "uh", "like", "you know", "i mean", "sort of", "kind of".
- Repairs and restarts in maybe a fifth of lines: "so the the thing is",
  "we could uh we could try", "i think i think thats right".
- Occasional homophone and near-miss errors, the kind a CTC model makes on
  audio: "there" for "their", "to" for "two", "wont" for "want", "quarry" for
  "query", "sequel" for "SQL", "vector" for "factor", "cash" for "cache",
  "no" for "know". Use these sparingly, one line in six or so.
- Some lines cut mid-sentence, because the endpointer fired early: "and then we
  just need to make sure that the". Do not add an ellipsis; it just stops.
- Realistic length spread. Many turns are two to five words. A few are long.
- Numbers usually spelled as heard: "twenty three", "two thousand", "q three".

WRONG (clean prose with the capitals removed, which is what you will do if you
are not careful):
  "could you explain how the caching layer handles invalidation"
RIGHT:
  "so could you uh explain how the cashing layer handles invalidation"
  "wait how does the the caching layer know when to"
  "whats the deal with invalidation there"

Do not make every line noisy in the same way. Vary which defect appears.

DO NOT REUSE ANY EXAMPLE STRING FROM THESE INSTRUCTIONS. The examples above and
below show the SHAPE to imitate, not text to copy. Every line you produce must
be one you invented for this specific mode and situation. Copying an example
verbatim makes the row worthless: it measures the instruction, not the language.
`;

const LABEL_RULES = `
LABELLING

Label what the utterance IS, not what a good assistant would do about it.

dialogue_act   ask | statement | answer | backchannel | interruption
               "ask" covers BOTH questions and requests. Do not try to separate
               them: "whats the status on the q three report" is a question in
               form and a request in function, and the distinction was measured
               to be unlearnable.
needs_response yes | no          (binary; there is no "optional")
               "no" is the important one and it is COMMON in a live call.
               Backchannels ("mhm", "right", "yeah exactly"), the other party
               thinking aloud, two other people talking to each other, admin
               chatter, and the USER'S OWN speech on their own channel are all
               needs_response=no.
voice          first_person_script | advisor | capture | silent
               MUST be "silent" whenever needs_response is "no".

               For a responding turn, voice is decided by WHO SPEAKS THE OUTPUT,
               and it follows the mode. Getting this wrong is the single most
               common labelling error, because "advisor" sounds like the safe
               default and it is wrong in most modes.

               first_person_script — the user will SAY the output OUT LOUD, as
                 themselves, with no editing. The output is their script.
                 This is the DEFAULT in: technical-interview, looking-for-work,
                 sales, seminar, call-center. A candidate answering an
                 interviewer, a seller answering a prospect, a presenter
                 answering the audience, an agent answering a customer: all
                 first_person_script.
               advisor — the output is guidance ABOUT the situation, written to
                 the user, never spoken aloud. The DEFAULT in: recruiting (the
                 user is evaluating someone else), lecture (explaining a concept
                 to the student), general.
               capture — the output is a RECORD of what was said: an action
                 item, a decision, a risk. The DEFAULT in team-meet, which
                 switches to first_person_script only when the user is called on
                 by name and must reply.
               silent — needs_response is "no".

               Deviating from the mode default is allowed and sometimes correct,
               but it must be justified in notes. If you are labelling a sales
               or interview turn "advisor", stop and check: is the user really
               being given advice, or are they being given words to say?
task           answer | explain | create | debug | summarize | compare | rewrite
               | plan | research | extract | none
               MUST be "none" whenever needs_response is "no".
secondary_tasks  Additional tasks for genuinely multi-intent turns, else [].
                 "find the bug and give me the fixed implementation" is
                 task=debug with secondary_tasks=["create"].
mode_intent    One of the mode's own labels, listed below.
answer_form    code | fact | explanation | example | recommendation | summary
               | rebuttal | steps | table | none
grounding      profile | mode_files | knowledge_base | conversation_memory | none
               You may ONLY use "mode_files" when mode_has_reference_files is
               true for that row. If it is false, "mode_files" is forbidden.
capabilities   any of conversation_context, screen, files, retrieval, web, tools
current_information  true only if answering needs facts newer than a model's
                     training data (live prices, today's news, current headcount).

legacy_intent  Additionally map the turn onto the OLD eight-label taxonomy so the
               control model can be scored: coding | clarification | follow_up |
               deep_dive | behavioral | example_request | summary_probe | general.
               Pick the closest. Most live non-questions map to "general".

/**

  hinglish: `LANGUAGE: HINGLISH (Hindi-English code-switching), as an English-trained
speech model transcribes it.

- Latin script only. Never Devanagari.
- Switch mid-sentence the way bilingual professionals actually do: English for
  technical nouns, Hindi for the connective and emotional tissue. "matlab", "toh",
  "haan", "nahi", "thoda", "abhi", "kya", "bas", "acha", "theek hai", "yaar",
  "kar diya", "ho gaya", "karna hai", "chahiye", "lagta hai", "pata nahi".
- Technical terms stay English: "deployment", "latency", "pull request", "sprint".
- The model mis-transcribes Hindi words it half-knows: "matlab" as "mutlub",
  "acha" as "archa", "theek" as "teek", "haan" as "han" or "hun". Use this in
  maybe one line in five.
- All the English STT rules still apply: no punctuation, no capitals, fillers,
  repairs, mid-sentence cuts.

Examples of the SHAPE (do not copy these):
  "toh matlab uh deployment kab hoga"
  "haan haan wo to ho gaya bas testing baaki hai"
  "nahi yaar thoda latency issue aa raha hai abhi"`,

  manglish: `LANGUAGE: MANGLISH (Malayalam-English code-switching), as an
English-trained speech model transcribes it.

- Latin script only. Never Malayalam script.
- Malayalam carries the grammar and the discourse markers, English carries the
  technical nouns: "enthaa", "alle", "aanu", "illa", "und", "pinne", "ippo",
  "sheri", "athu", "ithu", "cheyyam", "venam", "ariyilla", "nokkam", "mathi",
  "kittiyo", "parayu", "ok aanu".
- Malayalam agglutinates, so the model runs words together or splits them
  wrongly: "cheyyanam" as "cheyanam" or "cheyya nam", "ariyilla" as "ari illa",
  "enthaanu" as "entha anu". Use this in maybe one line in four, since it is
  more common than the Hindi case.
- Technical terms stay English: "database", "merge", "standup", "release".
- All the English STT rules still apply: no punctuation, no capitals, fillers,
  repairs, mid-sentence cuts.
