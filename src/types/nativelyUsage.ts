/**
 * The shape of GET /v1/usage and GET /v1/plans on the Natively API.
 *
 * ONE definition, imported by both the preload bridge and the renderer. The
 * quota type used to be written out twice — once in electron/preload.ts and
 * once in src/types/electron.d.ts — and the two are the contract the settings
 * panel renders from, so a field added on the server had to be remembered in
 * three places. It is type-only, so nothing here survives into the bundle.
 *
 * ── THE FOUR CATEGORIES AND THE FIVE METERS ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The product shows four things: AI Usage, Knowledge Usage, Voice Usage and
 * Research. The server meters five resources: AI tokens, embedding tokens,
 * reranker tokens, STT minutes and research credits. Knowledge is the composite
 * — embeddings and reranking have separate quotas and separate economics, so
 * they stay separate everywhere except the headline number.
 *
 * ── WHY THE LEGACY FIELDS ARE STILL HERE ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `transcription`, `search` and `embedding` are aliases the server still emits
 * for builds that shipped before this model existed. This app reads the new
 * names; the aliases are typed so nobody deletes them from the server thinking
 * they are unused, and so a mixed-version debugging session has the shape
 * written down.
