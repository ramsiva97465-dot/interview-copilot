/**
 * AI-provider brand marks — the single source for every surface that names a
 * cloud MODEL provider.
 *
 * Extracted from AIProvidersSettings.tsx, which still re-exports all three maps
 * under their original `AIP_*` names. It moved here because a second surface
 * needs them: the overlay's model picker rendered a generic <Cloud> glyph for
 * every provider except Gemini, so "Llama 3.1 8B (Nvidia Nim)" and every OpenAI,
 * Claude, DeepSeek and Groq entry shipped with no brand at all. Duplicating the
 * registry there is exactly the drift src/assets/provider-logos/README.md warns
 * about, so there is one map and two renderers over it:
 *
 *   <AipProviderMark>  tiled,      Settings > AI Providers (needs AIP_CSS)
 *   <ProviderMark>     tile-less,  anywhere else (the model picker)
 *
 * Adding a provider means adding it HERE, once. See the README for licence rules
 * and for why some brands stay monograms.
 *
 * Imported with `?raw` and inlined rather than used as <img src>: most of these
 * paint with `fill="currentColor"`, which does not resolve inside an <img> — a
 * separate document context — so the monochrome marks would render black and
 * disappear against the dark theme.
