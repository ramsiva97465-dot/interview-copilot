/**
 * The monthly usage panel reports a PROPORTION, not the plan's allowance.
 *
 * "Usage this month" used to read "4.1M / 6.5M · 63%", which prints the exact
 * entitlement on screen. It now reads "63%" — the same "am I running low?"
 * signal without spelling out what the plan grants.
 *
 * The trial panel deliberately KEEPS the pair: a trial's allowance is public,
 * and a trial user is exactly the person deciding whether a task will fit. So
 * this is not "percentages everywhere" and a blanket change to ResourceMeter
 * would be wrong — which is what these assertions pin.
 *
 * Source assertions, because the panel is a large motion-heavy component with
 * no render harness in this repo. They check the CALL SITES rather than any
 * rendered string, so a copy tweak cannot fail them falsely.
