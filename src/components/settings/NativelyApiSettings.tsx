 * monthly panel takes the percentage. The two never render together — trial and
 * saved-key states are mutually exclusive in practice — so this is one style per
 * screen, not two on one.

  //     animates in the instant the numbers land, which reads as "the data just
  //     arrived" because that is what happened;

               heading, `natively-key-card` material, the brand mark on a 12px
               explainer line, and one full-width `natively-key-cta`. Its own

          `usageData`, which comes from /v1/usage authenticated with a real
          key, and a trial authenticates with `x-trial-token` against the
          sentinel `__trial__` — so the whole usage table was simply absent
          for exactly the people with the tightest allowances and the most
          reason to watch them. The pills on the trial card show progress
          bars; they do not show used-against-limit numbers.

          Same ResourceMeter rows as the paid table, so the two read
          identically. "this trial", not "this month": a trial does not
          reset, it ends — the countdown for that is on the card above. */}
