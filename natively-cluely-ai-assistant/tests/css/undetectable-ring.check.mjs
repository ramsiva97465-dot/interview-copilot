// Regression check: the overlay shell card must carry a visible dashed ring
// while undetectable mode is on, in every interface theme.
//
// Background: undetectable mode has no in-panel tell. It flips
// setContentProtection on the overlay/pill/toggle windows, hides the macOS
// Dock entry and the Windows taskbar button — all state you can only confirm
// by looking somewhere other than the panel you are using. The dashed ring
// added in src/index.css (@undetectable-ring fences) is that tell.
//
// The defect this guards is a cascade one, and it is the reason the ring is an
// OUTLINE rather than a restyled border. `.overlay-shell-surface` is redefined
// per interface theme with `border-color: … !important` — liquid-glass forces
// it to `transparent` outright — and `appearance.shellStyle` sets
// `borderColor` INLINE on the same element. A `border-style`/`border-color`
// rule for the ring would therefore lose the cascade in exactly the themes
// nobody would think to check, and ship as dead CSS. That is the same failure
// documented for PR #499 in the cursor lock directly above the ring rule.
//
// Why this runs in Electron rather than by reading the stylesheet: a text
// assertion cannot tell you who WINS a cascade — and reading the rule is what
// missed the `!important` the first time. This resolves the real cascade in
// the real engine, across the full theme matrix, and reads getComputedStyle.
//
// Run: npm run test:css:undetectable-ring
//
// The check asserts FOUR directions so it cannot silently rot:
//   1. undetectable on            → dashed 2px ring at offset +3px, in every
//                                   interface theme × colour theme
//   2. the ring colour is VISIBLE → non-transparent, and alpha above a floor
//                                   (a ring at alpha 0.05 is not an indicator)
//   3. undetectable off / unset   → the ring stays in the box (so the colour
//                                   channel can fade it) but fully TRANSPARENT
//                                   — invisibility, not absence
//   4. with the ring block cut    → no outline even with the mode on (proves
//                                   the rule is load-bearing, not decoration)
//
// The WIDTH assertion is load-bearing, and is why it is a whole number.
// Chromium resolves the USED outline-width per device-pixel-ratio: the first
// draft of this ring specified 1.5px, which came back as 1.5px on the Retina
// display it was written on but was floored to 1px at DPR 1, where the dashes
// collapse into a hairline nobody can see. The width also sets the DASH
// geometry (Chromium derives dash length and gap from it), so it is not a free
// knob. DPR 1 is the DEFAULT on most Windows
// displays, so that draft would have shipped an invisible indicator to most
// Windows users while looking correct on the author's Mac. It also would have
// made THIS check flaky — passing on a Retina display and failing on a 1x one.
// An integer width resolves identically at every scale, which is what makes the
// assertion below DPI-invariant. Verified live under --force-device-scale-factor=1.
//
// The offset assertion is load-bearing too, and its direction is the whole
// point. The ring sits OUTSIDE the card, in a transparent gutter that had to be
// created for it: the card used to be flush to the native window on both axes
// (measured live at y=0, h=153.625 in a 154px window), so anything painted past
// the card's box was clipped away. OVERLAY_PANEL_INSET (padding on contentRef,
// whose offsetHeight is the window height) is that gutter, and offset + width
// must fit inside it. Overflowing produces no error and no warning — the ring
// just loses an edge — so both halves are asserted here.
