 * Map the provider error classifier's nine kinds onto the four error slots a

 * silently swallow `auth`, and an expired API key is precisely the condition a
 * user needs a reliability signal for — it is one of the diagnostic gaps this
 * feature exists to close. Every kind therefore has an explicit destination and
 * a reason:
 *
 *   rate_limit  → rate_limit         the provider is throttling us
 *   auth        → client_error       the KEY is wrong; retrying cannot fix it
 *   overloaded  → server_error       503/529 is the provider's capacity, not ours
 *   server_error→ server_error
 *   network     → connection_failure DNS/ECONNRESET never reached the provider
 *   timeout     → null               our OWN deadline; the driver's `reason`
 *                                    already says that, and classifying it here
 *                                    too would double-count one event
 *   zero_token  → null               the stream ENDED cleanly with no text. That
 *                                    is an answer-quality failure, not a
 *                                    transport one, and the answer layer already
 *                                    owns it (regeneration / canned line)
 *   stall       → null               a content-free clarification is likewise a
 *                                    quality judgement about text we received
 *   none        → null               not a provider failure at all
 *
 * `null` means "this classifier has nothing to add" — the sample then falls
 * through to the stream's own outcome, which is the honest answer.

 *
 *   • `replayAnswerCall` truncates the inherited prompt at 24000 chars, so a
 *     repair on a 32K turn is actually a ~6K request. Filing it under the
 *     answer's workload bucket corrupts `meanInputTokens`, which is the
 *     x-coordinate the whole context fit stands on.
 *   • A repair fires immediately after the answer on a WARM connection, so its
 *     TTFT is systematically lower. `foldLatency` nudges `p50Ms` toward each
 *     sample and `performanceGrade` reads `p50Ms` first — a slow provider could
 *     grade "fast" on the strength of its own repair latencies.
 *   • Their deadline is deliberately SHORTER than the answer's
 *     (`repairDeadlineMs` is a fraction of the route budget), so a repair
 *     timeout says nothing about provider health.
 *
 * They are still worth OBSERVING. A repair window that expires before a slow
 * gateway's first token is a repair that can never land, and that failure is
 * silent — the user simply never sees their answer improve. So the outcomes are
 * tallied process-locally and surfaced in diagnostics, and reach no profile.
