/**
 * Pure, unit-tested decision helpers for streaming-STT reconnection.
 *
 * Context: the streaming providers (Soniox, Deepgram, ElevenLabs, …) cap
 * automatic reconnects at RECONNECT_MAX_ATTEMPTS and then latch
 * `shouldReconnect = false` so a flapping endpoint can't storm forever. But
 * that latch is permanent for the life of the session: once it trips, the
 * write()-driven lazy reconnect never fires again, so the STT is dead until the
 * user manually stops/starts the meeting.
 *
 * Real-world failure (reported): the user hides the app for a while. During the
 * silent/hidden stretch the socket drops and the backoff ladder quietly burns
 * all its attempts (≈2 min with exponential backoff). When the user comes back
 * and speaks, audio flows into write() again — but `shouldReconnect` is already
 * latched off, so nothing reconnects and the UI sits on "STT reconnecting"
 * forever.
 *
 * Fix: genuine audio arriving at write() means the capture pipeline is alive and
 * the user wants transcription again. Grant the session ONE fresh reconnect
 * budget instead of staying dead — but only after a cooldown since the last
 * exhaustion, so a genuinely-dead endpoint can't be re-stormed on every chunk.
 *
 * These functions are pure so they can be unit-tested without a WebSocket,
 * network, or Electron. See __tests__/SttReconnectRevival.test.mjs (decision
 * table) and __tests__/SonioxReviveWiring.test.mjs (wiring into write()).
