// electron/services/hostedKeyActivation.ts
//
// What a pasted hosted API key should turn on, and what it must not.
//
// MeetFloo was the only key that did anything on its own: setMeetFlooApiKey()
// promotes the reranker to 'MeetFloo' and readHostedModel() falls back to the
// managed model. Every other hosted key was written to the credential store and
// then ignored — setOpenrouterApiKey/setJinaApiKey save and return, and both
// retrieval consumers gate on a MODEL as well as a key:
//
//   • readHostedModel returns settings.jinaModel / settings.openrouterModel
//     raw, so a keyed provider with no model chosen fails eligibility as
//     'no-model' and silently falls back to the local cross-encoder.
//   • EmbeddingProviderResolver builds a hosted candidate only under
//     `key && model` — a pasted Voyage key adds NO candidate to the chain.
//
// So the key was accepted and changed nothing, with no symptom: reranking that
// does not happen just leaves the cosine order, and an absent embedding
// candidate falls through to the bundled model. This module decides the
// activation; the callers do the I/O.
//
// ── THE GUARDS ARE THE FEATURE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// setRerankerProviderIfManaged already documents three, and every reason it
// gives is provider-independent, so they apply here unchanged:
//
//   1. Promote only from an AUTO-DEFAULT. An explicit pick is a decision, and
//      replacing it the moment a key is added is a bug this repo has already
//      fixed once on the model side (see AUTO_ASSIGNED_MODEL_IDS).
//   2. Ask the PRIVACY POLICY first. A hosted reranker ships retrieved document
//      text off the machine on the next BACKGROUND query, with nothing invoked
//      by the user; hosted embeddings do the same on the next index. Promoting
//      into a denied scope would also arm itself later, if the scope were ever
//      allowed for an unrelated reason.
//   3. REVERT symmetrically on a cleared key, or the user is left pointed at a
//      provider that cannot authenticate — and a failed rerank keeps the
//      existing order, so nothing surfaces.
//
// And one this module adds, because it is the first to activate a provider
// whose catalogue is fetched rather than curated:
//
//   4. Never store a model id we did not verify exists. OpenRouter's rerank
//      catalogue is live (staticCatalogue: false) and the ids in the original
//      brief did not exist on the real API — see openrouterRerankModels.ts.
//      A failed fetch leaves the setting unset rather than guessing.
//
// ── WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// It does not write embeddingMode:'manual'. That would filter the candidate
// list to exactly one entry and delete the fallback chain — "a regression
// wearing the feature's clothes", in the words of the MeetFloo-key test that
// refused to do it for the same reason. Filling in the model and its width is
// what makes a keyed provider usable: the resolver then builds the candidate,
// and for Voyage ranks it above the generic chain. The user gets their key
// used, and still has a chain to fall back to.
