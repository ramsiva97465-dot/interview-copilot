 * under an automated (Playwright-driven) launch could not be decrypted by a
 * normal `electron .` launch, and vice versa, with the Keychain item untouched.
 * Chromium's OSCrypt falls back to a well-known key when the Keychain item is not
 * reachable by the calling process; both keys are stable, so each launcher
 * happily reads its OWN writes and silently cannot read the other's.
 *
 * The canary makes that difference observable BEFORE anything is overwritten:
 * whoever writes the credential file also writes this string encrypted with the
 * key it used, and a later session that cannot decrypt it back is provably
