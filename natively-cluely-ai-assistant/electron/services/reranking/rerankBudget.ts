/**
 * How long the rerank stage is allowed to take.
 *
 * The seam races the reranker against a deadline and keeps the pre-rerank
 * ordering if it loses. That deadline was written for the BUNDLED reranker, so
 * a user who never opened the panel would not pay a cold 400MB ONNX load on
 * their first-useful-token path just because reranking exists.
 *
 * That reason still holds. `bge-reranker-base` was removed outright (it
 * benchmarked WORSE than no reranker at all: MRR 0.7558 against a 0.8368
 * baseline), but a bundled default remains — `Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` —
 * and `shouldRerank` is `explicitlySelected || lowConfidence || rerankerOverride`,
 * so a low-confidence turn still escalates to it. BUNDLED_RERANK_BUDGET_MS is
 * therefore the budget of a real shipping path, not a vestige.
 *
 * It is the wrong deadline for a reranker the user chose. Measured on a real
 * configuration (2026-09-04): `qwen/qwen3-reranker-8b` via OpenRouter, whose
 * own Test Connection reported `ok` at 2052ms, lost the 1200ms race on every
 * query. The order never changed, and nothing surfaced that. Downloading a
 * model, selecting it, and watching its test pass bought nothing at all.
 *
 * So the budget follows the CHOICE, not just the surface:
 *
 *   bundled default  -> 1200ms on every surface (unchanged)
 *   user selected    -> 3000ms live, 8000ms manual
 *
 * The two selected budgets differ because the surfaces differ. A live
 * transcript turn is racing the speaker; a manual answer is already bounded by
 * MANUAL_HYBRID_RERANK_BUDGET_MS (8000ms) upstream, so matching it here spends
 * no deadline that was not already committed.
