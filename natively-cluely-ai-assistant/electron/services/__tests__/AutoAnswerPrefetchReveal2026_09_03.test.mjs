/**
 * Auto Answer prefetch adoption — live session 2026-09-03 (meeting gen 13).
 *
 * Two real questions were judged answerable (a=0.9 and a=1.0) and neither was
 * ever shown. Both died on the speculative prefetch:
 *
 *   13-q4  The prefetch FINISHED two seconds before the judge ruled. Its text
 *          was returned to a `.catch`-only caller and discarded; the dispatch
 *          then "adopted" a stream that no longer existed and returned. And
 *          because completion stamped lastTriggerTime, the planner's 3 s
 *          cooldown would have silenced the dispatch anyway.
 *   13-q6  The prefetch was STILL STREAMING when the verdict landed. The
 *          engine reported itself busy (mode what_to_say), the dispatch parked,
 *          and the next candidate superseded it 195 ms later.
 *
 * A speculative stream never renders (by design — the judge may say no), so
 * adoption is the ONLY moment it can become visible. These tests pin that a
 * prefetch adopted in either state reaches the renderer and the session.
 *
 * Same poke-the-instance pattern as AutoAnswerEngineReview2026_08_24.test.mjs:
 * a fake whatToAnswerLLM stream, the real runWhatShouldISay / adoption path.
