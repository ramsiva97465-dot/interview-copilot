// Regression test for: a worker the app spawns was never unpacked from the
// asar, so it silently no-opped in every packaged build.
//
// THE BUG. `ggufRerankerWorker.js` was missing from package.json's
// `asarUnpack`, while every one of its siblings — whisperWorker,
// intentClassifierWorker, localEmbeddingWorker, localRerankerWorker — was
// listed. (rerankerDownloadWorker was in that list too, until the bge lazy
// downloader it served was removed on 2026-09-04.)
//
// Why that is fatal rather than cosmetic. resolveRagWorker() ends with:
//
//     if (resolved.includes('app.asar') && !resolved.includes('app.asar.unpacked')) {
//       resolved = resolved.replace('app.asar', 'app.asar.unpacked');
//     }
//
// which is correct — a worker that loads a native addon cannot be read from
// inside an archive. But it rewrites UNCONDITIONALLY. In a packaged build
// `fs.existsSync` returns true for a path inside app.asar (Electron makes the
// archive look like a directory), so the worker resolves, gets rewritten to
// `app.asar.unpacked/electron/rag/ggufRerankerWorker.js`, and that file does
// not exist unless asarUnpack put it there. `new Worker(...)` then throws,
// GgufReranker.rerank() catches it and returns null, and the seam reads null as
// "keep the existing order".
//
// So: a user downloads a 400MB GGUF reranker, selects it, watches Test
// Connection pass — and in the shipped app it reorders nothing, with no error
// anywhere. Exactly the silent-no-op class that
// RagWorkerPathAcrossBundles2026_09_04 fixed for the DEV path; this is the
// packaged half of the same failure.
//
// It also became much more consequential the moment an explicitly-selected
// reranker started running on every query rather than 1 in 36
// (ActiveModelIsTheOneUsed2026_09_04).
//
// THE FIX, guarded here: every worker script the app actually spawns must
// appear in asarUnpack. Asserted by DERIVING the list from the source rather
// than hard-coding it, so a worker added later is covered without anyone
// remembering to update this file.
//
// THE EVIDENCE IS PARITY, not inference. After 7245da18 both rerankers resolve
// their worker through the SAME resolveRagWorker(), and localRerankerWorker.js
// — which is in asarUnpack — demonstrably works in production. This fix makes
// ggufRerankerWorker.js byte-for-byte identical in treatment to a
// proven-working sibling. The packing chain is confirmed too: package.json
// build.files includes "dist-electron", asar defaults to true, and the worker
// is present at dist-electron/electron/rag/ggufRerankerWorker.js — so it does
// land inside app.asar, which is exactly what triggers the rewrite.
//
// Cross-platform: asar packaging is identical on macOS and Windows, so this
// guard covers both. No packaged build was produced to observe the failure
// directly.
