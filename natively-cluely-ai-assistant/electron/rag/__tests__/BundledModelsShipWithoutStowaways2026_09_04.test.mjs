/**
 * extraResources copies resources/models/ into the installer, and it does NOT
 * honour .gitignore.
 *
 * electron-builder's getFileMatchers() handles extraResources without injecting
 * the default ignores (fileMatcher.ts adds no node_modules exclusion and does
 * not call getDefaultIgnoredPatterns()). Anything sitting in that directory
 * ships, gitignored or not.
 *
 * MEASURED on a developer machine, 2026-09-04: resources/models held 814MB, of
 * which 553MB was Xenova/bge-reranker-large - the model deliberately un-bundled
 * that day, left behind by an earlier download-models run and gitignored, so a
 * clean checkout and CI never saw it. A local `npm run dist` would have shipped
 * it, and `dist:signed` uploads the artifact automatically.
 *
 * A filter fixes that, but an allow-list can fail the other way: omit a needed
 * path and the app ships with no embedder and no reranker. So this checks BOTH
 * directions against the canonical list in scripts/download-models.js.
 *
 * Run: node --test electron/rag/__tests__/BundledModelsShipWithoutStowaways2026_09_04.test.mjs
