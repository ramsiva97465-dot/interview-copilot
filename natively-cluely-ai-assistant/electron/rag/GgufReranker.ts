/**
 * A GGUF reranker at the single rerank seam, via llama.cpp.
 *
 * Core already ran ONNX cross-encoders; this adds the other local format, so a
 * model published only as GGUF is usable without an extension.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT RUN — measured, not assumed:
 *
 *   bge-reranker-v2-m3   arch bert    -> llama.cpp's ranking path, 119ms for 5
 *   qwen3-reranker-0.6b  arch qwen3   -> no ranking head; yes/no token scoring
 *   jina-reranker-v3.5   arch qwen3   -> no ranking head; LISTWISE, scored from
 *                                        per-position hidden states through a
 *                                        projector that is not in the GGUF
 *
 * llama.cpp's ranking path needs a classification head and RANK pooling. The
 * two qwen3-architecture "rerankers" have neither, and are not scored the same
 * way as each other either — see qwenRerankPrompt.ts and jinaListwiseRerank.ts.
 * The mode is a property of the model, declared in the catalogue; guessing it
 * yields a refusal or a meaningless number, never a degraded score.
 *
 * Inference runs in a WORKER, not the main thread. That is the same rule the
 * ONNX reranker follows after the 2026-07-05 SIGTRAP crashes: llama.cpp is a
 * native addon that can abort, and off the main thread that is a recoverable
 * rerank failure rather than the app vanishing.
