/**
 * Pure helpers for the overlay's USER-CHOSEN window size (unit-tested).
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The overlay OS window has historically been a FIXED width (732 =
 * WindowHelper.OVERLAY_DEFAULT_WIDTH), with the panel animating 600↔732 purely
 * in CSS, centered inside it. That invariant is load-bearing: three separate
 * subsystems derive their geometry from "the window is 732 wide" —
 *
 *   1. the toggle aux window's anchor      (panelRight = (windowW + panelW) / 2)
 *   2. the settings/model popover margin   (WindowHelper.getOverlayPanelLeftMargin)
 *   3. the click-through hover gate        (margin = (windowW - panelW) / 2)
 *
 * — and a width setBounds on a transparent, backdrop-blurred window re-rasters
 * and flickers on macOS, because Chromium does not sync setBounds to renderer
 * paint.
 *
 * Making the overlay user-resizable does NOT mean giving up that invariant. It
 * means the window width becomes a value the user can change (rarely, by
 * dragging) instead of a compile-time constant — and every one of the three
 * consumers above reads that same value. Within a session the width is still
 * fixed for the entire expand/collapse spring, so there is still no width
 * setBounds during an animation. That is what these helpers encode.
 *
 * Everything here is pure so the geometry can be tested without a display:
 * see src/lib/__tests__/overlayCustomSize.test.mjs.

/**
 * The transparent gutter between the overlay WINDOW's edge and the painted

 *
 * It exists so undetectable mode's ring has somewhere to paint OUTSIDE the
 * card. Before it, the card was flush to the window on both axes (measured
 * live: card y=0, h=153.625 in a 154px window), so anything drawn beyond the
 * card's box — an outline, a box-shadow, anything — was clipped away by the
 * native window bounds. Proven by pixel-sampling a forced outward ring: the
 * side edges survived into the window's horizontal slack, the top and bottom
 * did not exist at all.
 *
 * Applied as padding on the overlay's contentRef, whose offsetHeight IS the
 * window height. The WINDOW keeps every number it had — this narrows the
 * PANEL, so the startup-slide birth width, the display budgets, persisted
 * custom sizes and the clamps in this file are all untouched.
 *
 * Horizontal slack was never new: the collapsed panel has always sat 66px in
 * from each window edge, which is why panelLeft, mx-auto, the hover gate and
 * the toggle anchor already cope with a panel narrower than its window. The
 * gutter extends that to the VERTICAL axis and to the fully expanded width.

 * How far OUTSIDE the panel the hover gate still counts the pointer as "over

 * This must stay BELOW OVERLAY_PANEL_INSET, and that is the whole reason it is
 * declared next to it. The gate inflates the panel rect by this much before
 * testing, so any part of the gutter within it is interactive — and an
 * interactive transparent region swallows clicks meant for the app underneath.
 * On an overlay whose entire value is not being noticed, an invisible border
 * that eats clicks is a behavioural tell, so the gutter has to stay
 * click-through even though it is inside the window.
 *
 * It is not zero: the gate flips the window via IPC, so a little hysteresis
 * keeps pointer jitter at the boundary from thrashing the flag. 2px is enough
 * for that while leaving most of the gutter transparent to clicks.
 *
 * Note this is a REDUCTION in the app's click-eating footprint, not a new
 * compromise. Before the gutter existed the same inflation was 8px, and on the
 * horizontal axis — where the collapsed panel has always had 66px of margin
 * inside its window — it was fully in effect: an 8px band around the panel
 * already swallowed clicks. The band is now 2px, on all four sides.
