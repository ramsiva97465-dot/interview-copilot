// One table across every report in reports/, ranked by the axis the campaign

// needs_response is the ranking key on purpose. It is the axis with the
// clearest product consequence (6.1% of live generations are provably wasted
// confirming there was nothing to say), it has only three classes so it is well
// powered at this corpus size, and unlike mode_intent it is not partitioned by
// mode into single-digit support.
