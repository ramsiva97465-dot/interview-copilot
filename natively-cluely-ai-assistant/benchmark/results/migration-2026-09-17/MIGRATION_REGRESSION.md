# DeepSeek model-id migration regression (2026-09-17)

Conversations: INT-M, SALES-S, TEAM-M, TECH-DISC-L · 3 runs each · same pipeline bundle, prompts, corpus and deadline overrides as the main benchmark. Only MeetFloo-api's `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` differs.

**Reading this table**
- DeepSeek documents `deepseek-v4-flash` as a retired alias served by DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash, and both arms report `deepseek-flash` as the answering model, so differences here are run-to-run sampling noise (no temperature is set on either side), not a model change.
- Anchor retention, unsupported numbers and superseded-value leaks are deterministic text checks, applied identically to both arms. They are coarser than the judge: the superseded-value check counts any occurrence of a number unique to a correction's initial value, so it over-counts (a "9" elsewhere in the summary matches). Use them for before/after deltas only.
- Hallucinated non-numeric content, speaker attribution and decision correctness were not checked: they need the LLM judge, whose Gemini key has no prepaid credits.
- A Gemini Flash-Lite arm was not run for the same reason (the key returns 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED), and because Flash-Lite is not the summary generator in MeetFloo-api: it is only the fallback leg after DeepSeek.
- Both arms ran in the DeepSeek off-peak window (before: 2026-09-16 20:04-20:48 UTC; after: 23:34-23:37 UTC), from the same machine.
