# CASUAL-M — casual_mixed, medium (28.3 min, 3726 words)

**Source transcript:** `benchmark/transcripts/src/CASUAL-M.txt`  
**Reference fact sheet:** `benchmark/references/CASUAL-M.json`  
**Context:** A casual video call among three old friends, Dan (the MeetFloo user), Priya and Tom. About half the call is catch-up and banter (a TV finale, five-a-side football, Priya's new puppy, work complaints); interleaved throughout is the planning of a 3-night cabin trip for their friend Maya's 30th birthday, plus a secret surprise visit from Maya's brother.

## What a good summary must include
- 3-night cabin trip for Maya's 30th at Heron Point Cabin, Birchwater Lake (F01, F03)

- Dan books the cabin (took over from Priya) and pays the $570 deposit due Fri Sept 25; Priya and Tom send $190 each (F16, F18, F19, F20, F51)
- Tom rents a 7-seat Ridgeway SUV by Oct 1; everyone meets at Priya's on Calloway Street at 9:30 Fri Oct 23 (F22, F24)
- Maya is celiac/strictly gluten-free, and the cabin allows no pets (F26, F28)
- Private chef rejected; Tom cooks gluten-free lasagna Saturday (F30, F31)
- Secret surprise: brother Jonah flies in from Denver Sat Oct 24; discuss only in the Operation Heron chat, not the group chat with Maya (F32, F33)

# Summary A

_(run2)_

### Title: Maya's Birchwater Birthday Trip

#### Overview
The group chose Heron Point Cabin at Birchwater Lake for Maya's three-night birthday weekend, tentatively October 16–19, and corrected the current four-payer estimate to $1,140 ($285 each), while pet access and Priya's rota remained unresolved. The cabin trip moved to October 23–26 at Heron Point, the chef was dropped, Dan took over booking the $570 deposit due September 25, Mia's attendance remained pending, and a secret Jonah surprise was organized. The group finalized a three-night Birchwater trip for Friday the 23rd through Monday the 26th with one Ridgeway SUV, set the gift contribution at $60 each, and left Jonah's airport transfer, Mia's attendance, kayaks, groceries, and the playlist unresolved. Key decisions: The group chose Birchwater Lake's Heron Point Cabin instead of Hollins Ridge for the three-night birthday trip.; The cabin stay will be three nights.; Maya will not pay for the birthday cabin, and the current four-payer split is $285 each from the corrected $1,140 total..

#### Summary
- The meeting finalized plans for a three-night birthday trip and selected Heron Point Cabin at Birchwater Lake over Hollins Ridge.
- The October trip will exclude the birthday guest from the cabin cost, with provisional shares for Dan, Priya, and Tom that would be lower if Mia joins.
- The group will cook rather than hire the chef, bring no dogs, use one Ridgeway SUV, keep the surprise in the separate Operation Heron chat, and accommodate celiac disease with separate food-preparation equipment while still needing a nearby gluten-free grocery option and a cabin-specific cross-contamination plan.

#### What changed
- Tom announced that he quit Pellmark, with a last day of October 9, and will start as a senior financial analyst at Halvorsen Logistics on November 2.
- Tom expects roughly three weeks between jobs in October.
- The birthday-trip search narrowed from Hollins Ridge and Birchwater Lake to Heron Point Cabin at Birchwater Lake.
- The stay is tentatively planned for Friday October 16 through Monday October 19, the weekend before Maya's October 21 birthday, pending Priya's rota check.
- The listed cabin total was corrected from $1,040 to $1,140 after the cleaning fee was noticed, making the current four-way estimate $285 each.
- Priya offered to book through Hearthstay and noted about $150 of credit from a cancelled Lisbon trip.
- The group clarified that Maya is strictly gluten-free because of celiac disease while Mia Chen is vegetarian.
- Waffles is now eleven weeks old and is due to start puppy class next Saturday.
- Priya reported that she is moving to day shifts in November after a 12.5-hour shift during a three-nurse shortage.
- The private-chef proposal for Saturday was deferred after an estimate of about $600, or $150 each for four people, was raised.
- The trip moved from the weekend of the 16th to October 23–26 because Priya is scheduled for nights on the original weekend and cannot swap again.
- Heron Point was confirmed open for the new dates at the same $1,140 total.
- The property was found to ban pets despite the pet-friendly filter, so Waffles was removed from the trip plan.
- The $600 chef option was dropped in favor of cooking at the cabin.
- Booking responsibility moved to Dan after Priya found her Hearthstay credit expired and her card flagged.
- The deposit was clarified as 50% or $570 due September 25 rather than at the end of the month, with the hold dropping afterward.
- Mia cannot attend Friday the 23rd because of a Portland wedding on the 24th, though Sunday remains possible and the cost split is therefore provisional.
- Jonah's planned surprise visit from Denver was added, and the group created Operation Heron to coordinate it secretly.
- A seven-seater became Tom's rental plan to accommodate up to five people if Mia joins.
- A separate chat named Operation Heron had already been created, with Speaker 1 planning to add the other two participants after the call.
- The group set a secrecy rule excluding Jonah references, jokes, and likes on his posts outside Operation Heron.
- The trip itinerary was confirmed as Birchwater Lake and Heron Point from Friday the 23rd through Monday the 26th.
- The group settled on one Ridgeway SUV instead of separate cars because Me did not trust the noisy car for a three-hour drive.
- The departure plan is 9:30 on Friday the 23rd from Priya's Calloway Street home, with Tom picking up Maya en route.
- The gift contribution increased to $60 per person and $180 total so the group can cover the $179 green Polaroid.
- Priya took responsibility for buying the Polaroid and ordering it by October 16th.
- The proposed four-night stay was rejected, leaving a three-night trip because Tuesday work and the extra $325-plus cost were not workable.
- Me committed to book the lodging and pay the $570 deposit before Friday.
- The plan now excludes dogs and records Maya as gluten-free and Mia as vegetarian.

- Priya will buy the Polaroid and order it by October 16th.

- Priya will send the $190 mentioned at the end of the call tonight.

- The group should use Operation Heron to resolve Mia's attendance and the kayak decision.
- Someone needs to check for a gluten-free grocery option near Birchwater.
- Someone needs to make a playlist for the drive.

#### Open questions
- Priya has not confirmed whether her rota allows the proposed October 16–19 stay.
- The group still does not know whether Waffles is allowed at Heron Point Cabin.
- Mia Chen's attendance and contribution to the four-payer split are not definite because she was only described as probably attending.
- The group has not decided whether to hire the proposed private chef for Saturday night.
- No nearby grocery store has yet been identified for gluten-free supplies.
- The cabin's ability to support separate food-preparation equipment for Maya has not been established.
- Will Mia attend any part of the October 23–26 trip, possibly Sunday, given her cousin's wedding in Portland on Saturday the 24th?
- Will Anjali be able to take Waffles that weekend?
- Which nearby grocery store can reliably stock gluten-free supplies?
- Will the group order Crumb and Kettle's gluten-free cake or bake one at the cabin?
- Will the group rent kayaks on Birchwater, and if so, when?
- What time will the group leave on Friday?
- Will the green Polaroid camera be the group gift, and will its price fit the proposed $50-per-person contribution?
- Jonah's airport-to-cabin transportation remains unresolved.
- Mia's attendance remains unresolved, and her card-and-flowers role is conditional on her coming.
- Whether kayaks will be included is still undecided.
- The group has not determined which gluten-free grocery option near Birchwater to use.
- The person responsible for creating the drive playlist is still unknown.

#### Risks / blockers
- The October 16–19 booking could conflict with Priya's rota.
- The reservation could fail to accommodate Waffles if the pet policy is not actually applicable.
- Maya's celiac disease makes gluten cross-contamination a serious food-safety concern.
- The cabin cost was initially misread by $100 because the cleaning fee was omitted.
- The private-chef option could add about $600 to the trip and was viewed as potentially excessive.
- The four-payer calculation depends on Mia Chen joining, but her attendance is not confirmed.
- Food logistics remain a risk because neither gluten-free grocery access nor the required separate equipment has been verified.
- Maya's gluten-free requirement creates a cross-contamination risk and requires separate equipment such as a toaster and chopping board.
- Bringing Waffles would violate Heron Point's no-pet rule and could trigger the $250 pet-hair fee.
- The booking hold drops after Friday, September 25 if the 50% $570 deposit is not paid.
- Priya cannot book directly because her Hearthstay credit expired and her card was previously flagged, making Dan's booking a dependency.
- Mia's uncertain attendance changes the provisional cost from $380 each for three payers to $285 each if four people pay.
- The original weekend of the 16th is unavailable because Priya is scheduled for nights Friday through Sunday and cannot swap again.
- Late-October kayaking may be uncomfortable or risky because the water is expected to be freezing and Priya expects she may fall in.
- The Jonah surprise could be spoiled if anyone mentions him in Maya's birthday group chat or jokes about him elsewhere.
- The cake plan remains constrained by a previously dry gluten-free cake and doubts that anyone can bake successfully.
- The surprise could be spoiled if Maya sees birthday-chat messages, jokes, or social-media activity about Jonah.
- Jonah's airport-to-cabin transfer is a major logistics risk because Birchwater is about three hours from the airport and the available car will be at the lake.
- The one-car plan depends on securing the Ridgeway SUV because Me's car is making a noise and is not trusted for the three-hour route.
- Late-October weather cannot yet be forecast, and nights may be near freezing.
- Food planning is incomplete because no gluten-free store near Birchwater has been checked, while Maya is gluten-free and Mia is vegetarian.
- The $179 gift exceeded the earlier $150 total and $50-each contribution plan.
- A fourth night was blocked by Speaker 1's Tuesday shift and the additional $325-plus cost.

#### Notes
- Maya turns 30 on Wednesday, October 21, making the proposed October 16–19 stay the weekend before her birthday.
- Heron Point Cabin is listed as three bedrooms, sleeping six, on the water, with a hot tub and a $325 nightly rate plus fees.
- Birchwater is about three hours away versus roughly four and a half hours to Hollins Ridge, whose previous trip included a broken heater and sleeping in coats.
- Waffles is eleven weeks old, has chewed two phone chargers and a work clog, and bit the vet's stethoscope; his trainer Brenda previously trained police dogs.
- Mia Chen is the book-club Mia, while the other Mia from Maya's work has moved to London.
- Priya described a 12.5-hour shift while three nurses were short-staffed and said she is moving to day shifts in November.
- Dan's work reorganization currently has a pre-meeting and a 22-slide deck built mostly from boxes and arrows, including an Alignment slide.
- The proposed private chef would cook five courses and handle the dishes for an estimated $600.
- Maya is gluten-free and Mia is vegetarian.
- Maya also has a major work presentation on Friday the 16th, which supported holding the celebration later.
- The remaining $570 is scheduled to be charged automatically two weeks before check-in.
- The proposed gift is a green Polaroid camera, with a tentative $50 contribution from each person while the price is checked.
- Birchwater kayak rental was quoted at about $45 per person for a half day.
- Ridgeway's seven-seater SUVs were quoted at about $64 per day.
- Dan's rent will rise by $200 per month when his lease renews in January, and he is viewing roughly six listings per night.
- Dan is considering a riverside fourth-floor walk-up as part of his apartment search.
- Tom's Halvorsen interview took five rounds, and his laptop and case-study marker died during the final exercise before he was hired.
- Tom starts Halvorsen on November 2 in a hybrid role with two work-from-home days, and the company will pay for CFA level two certification if he wants it.
- Jonah wants to fly from Denver, arrive Saturday afternoon on the 24th, and walk in before dinner while Maya believes the weekend is otherwise just four people.
- Jonah has not seen Maya for about fourteen months since moving to Denver, and Maya says she misses him.
- Maya is not a morning person, which was the reason given for avoiding an 8:00 departure.
- The late-October conditions were estimated at around fifty during the day and near freezing at night, so layers were recommended.
- The group described the expected cold weather as suitable for using the hot tub.
- The selected gift is the green Polaroid priced at $179.
- Speaker 1 cannot stay through Tuesday because of a Tuesday morning shift.
- The one-car choice was described as more fun together in addition to avoiding Me's unreliable car.
- Mia might handle the card and flowers only if she attends, while Maya is gluten-free and Mia is vegetarian.

- [medium] Waffles may not be permitted because the listing's pet-friendly status was not verified.
- [high] Maya's celiac disease creates a high food-safety risk if gluten cross-contamination occurs, requiring separate preparation equipment.
- [medium] The accommodation budget was initially understated by $100 because the cleaning fee was missed.
- [medium] A private chef would add about $600 total, or $150 per payer, on top of the cabin and was described as sounding excessive.
- [medium] The four-payer cost assumption depends on Mia Chen, whose attendance was described only as probable.
- [medium] No nearby gluten-free food source or cabin-specific cross-contamination plan has been confirmed.
- [medium] Maya's gluten-free requirement creates a cross-contamination risk and requires separate equipment such as a toaster and chopping board.

- [high] The booking hold drops after Friday, September 25 if the 50% $570 deposit is not paid.
- [medium] Priya cannot book directly because her Hearthstay credit expired and her card was previously flagged, making Dan's booking a dependency.
- [medium] Mia's uncertain attendance changes the provisional cost from $380 each for three payers to $285 each if four people pay.
- [medium] The original weekend of the 16th is unavailable because Priya is scheduled for nights Friday through Sunday and cannot swap again.

- [medium] The Ridgeway SUV must be secured by October 1st for the agreed transportation plan.

#### Follow-up draft
Subject: Follow-up: Birchwater birthday trip

Hi team,

Thanks, everyone, for working through the birthday-trip details. We aligned on a three-night stay at Heron Point Cabin at Birchwater Lake from October 23–26, with Dan booking the $1,140 lodging and paying the $570 deposit; Maya is excluded from the cabin cost, so the working shares are $380 each for Dan, Priya, and Tom, dropping to $285 if Mia joins. We’ll cook rather than hire a chef, bring no dogs, use one Ridgeway SUV, and keep Jonah’s surprise in Operation Heron. Can we confirm a safe gluten-free setup for Maya, including separate kitchen equipment and a reliable nearby grocery option?

Best,

### Title: Maya’s Heron Point Birthday Trip

#### Overview
The group chose Heron Point Cabin at Birchwater Lake for Maya's birthday weekend, corrected the shared cost to $285 each, and assigned Priya to book pending rota and pet-policy checks. The group moved the cabin trip to October 23–26, assigned booking and transport tasks, set the September 25 deposit plan, and began coordinating a secret visit from Jonah. The group finalized the Birchwater Lake birthday trip for October 23–26, confirmed one shared SUV and the $179 gift split, and left Mia, Jonah’s transport, kayaks, and groceries unresolved. Key decisions: The group selected Heron Point Cabin at Birchwater Lake instead of the Hollins Ridge option.; Maya will not contribute to the cabin cost, leaving four paying people to split the corrected total of $1,140 at $285 each.; The private-chef proposal was parked rather than approved..

#### Summary
- The meeting focused on planning a birthday weekend at Heron Point Cabin on Birchwater Lake.
- The group chose the cabin over Hollins Ridge, agreed on the stated shared-cost arrangement, and decided to cook rather than hire a private chef.
- The trip will use one shared SUV with no dogs, accommodate the guest’s celiac-related gluten-free requirements through strict cross-contamination controls, and coordinate the surprise only through Operation Heron.

#### What changed

- Tom reported that he left Pellmark, with his last day on October 9th, and will start as a senior financial analyst at Halvorsen Logistics on November 2nd.
- Priya said she will move to day shifts in November.
- The trip dates changed to October 23–26, when Heron Point was confirmed available at the same $1,140 total price.
- Mia became uncertain for the revised dates because she has a cousin's wedding in Portland on Saturday, October 24.
- Jonah offered to fly from Denver and surprise Maya by arriving Saturday afternoon before dinner.
- The booking responsibility shifted to Dan because Priya's credit had expired and her card had previously been flagged.
- The deposit requirement was clarified as 50%, or $570, due by Friday, September 25 rather than at the end of the month.
- Waffles was ruled out for the cabin because the listing's house rules prohibit pets despite the pet-friendly search filter.
- The trip itinerary was consolidated as Birchwater Lake at Heron Point from Friday the 23rd through Monday the 26th.
- The group settled on a 9:30 Friday departure from Priya’s place on Calloway Street.
- Transportation changed from a possible separate-car plan to one shared SUV.
- The gift contribution increased from the proposed $50 each to $60 each to cover the $179 Polaroid.
- The possible four-night stay was rejected in favor of three nights because of schedule and cost concerns.
- The group explicitly added no dogs and recorded Maya’s gluten-free and Mia’s vegetarian requirements.

#### Decisions
- The group agreed on Birchwater Lake and specifically Heron Point Cabin for the birthday weekend.
- The planned weekend is October 16th–19th, though Priya still needs to verify her rota.
- Maya will be excluded from the four-way cabin cost split because the trip is her birthday celebration.
- The private-chef idea was deferred for later consideration.
- The group confirmed October 23–26 as the new trip dates.
- The chef option was rejected because the $600 cost was considered too high relative to the cabin price.
- The group will cook its own meals, with Tom volunteering to make gluten-free lasagna for Saturday dinner.
- Dan will pay the deposit and Priya and Tom will reimburse him $190 each.
- The Jonah surprise will be managed through Operation Heron rather than the group chat that includes Maya.
- Operation Heron is the exclusive channel for Jonah-related planning to protect the surprise.
- The group will use one SUV for the trip.
- The group will keep the stay to three nights rather than extend it through Tuesday.

#### Action items

#### Open questions
- Whether Waffles can attend the trip remains unresolved.

- The group has not identified a nearby store that can support Maya's gluten-free requirements.
- Mia has not confirmed whether she can attend the revised trip dates.
- The group has not decided whether to order or bake Maya's gluten-free cake.
- Kayaking remains undecided because Priya is concerned about falling into cold late-October water.
- The Friday departure time remains unresolved after Tom suggested 8 a.m.
- The group still needs to identify a nearby grocery store that stocks gluten-free food.
- Mia’s attendance is still unresolved.
- Jonah’s route from the airport to the cabin has not been arranged.
- Kayak plans remain undecided.
- The group still needs to identify a gluten-free grocery option near Birchwater.

#### Risks / blockers
- The booking could be blocked by Priya's rota if she cannot take the proposed dates.
- The cabin's pet policy is uncertain, creating a potential issue for bringing Waffles.
- Maya's celiac disease makes cross-contamination during food preparation a significant safety concern.
- The unplanned cleaning fee raised the shared cabin cost by $100 overall.
- A private chef would add a substantial extra cost and has therefore not been approved.
- The cabin's no-pet rule creates a care requirement for Waffles and exposes the group to a $250 pet-hair fee if violated.
- Maya's gluten-free diet requires strict cross-contamination controls, including separate preparation equipment.
- The reservation is at risk if the $570 deposit is not paid by September 25 because the date hold will expire.
- Mia's uncertain participation creates a temporary increase from $285 to $380 per person for the other three attendees.
- Jonah's surprise is vulnerable to accidental disclosure because Maya is in the existing birthday group chat.
- The surprise could be exposed if anyone mentions Jonah in the birthday group chat or interacts with Jonah’s posts.
- Jonah’s airport transfer is a significant logistical gap because the cabin is approximately three hours from the airport.
- The trip depends on securing the one shared SUV because the other car is unreliable for the long drive.
- Lack of confirmed gluten-free shopping near Birchwater could create a food-planning problem for Maya.

#### Notes
- The cabin has three bedrooms, sleeps six, is on the water, and includes a hot tub.
- Birchwater is approximately three hours away, compared with roughly four and a half hours for Hollins Ridge.
- Maya is strictly gluten-free because she has celiac disease, while Mia Chen is vegetarian.
- The group expects four paying participants: Dan, Priya, Tom, and Mia Chen.
- Maya turns 30 on Wednesday, October 21st, making the planned trip the weekend before her birthday.
- Tom is between jobs for much of October and said this is relevant to the trip.
- The remaining $570 cabin balance will be charged automatically two weeks before check-in.
- Tom volunteered to rent a vehicle large enough for five people in case Mia attends, and selected a seven-seater as the working plan.
- Jonah is Maya's brother and plans to fly in from Denver, arriving Saturday afternoon, October 24.
- Tom's Saturday dinner plan is gluten-free lasagna.
- The cake from Crumb and Kettle was considered because it offers a gluten-free option, but its previous cake was described as dry.
- Maya has not seen Jonah since he moved to Denver roughly fourteen months earlier, which is part of why the surprise is considered especially meaningful.
- The $179 green Polaroid was selected as the gift, with Mia potentially handling a card and flowers if she attends.
- Late-October conditions were described as roughly 50 degrees during the day and near freezing at night, so layers were recommended.
- Maya is expected to be picked up by Speaker 2 on the way to the 9:30 meeting.
- The group joked about a drive playlist but did not assign a creator.

#### Follow-up draft
Subject: Heron Point Cabin birthday weekend

Hi team,

Thanks for the thoughtful discussion on Maya’s birthday weekend. We aligned on Heron Point Cabin at Birchwater Lake for October 23–26, with Dan paying the $570 deposit by September 25; we’ll cook rather than hire a chef, use one shared SUV with no dogs, split the $1,140 cabin cost at $285 each among four paying participants, and coordinate Jonah’s surprise only through Operation Heron. We’ll also plan strict cross-contamination controls for Maya’s gluten-free requirements. The main open question is whether Mia can attend the revised dates, since that determines the final cost split and transport planning.

Best,

- [high] Maya has celiac disease and requires strict gluten-free preparation, including protection against cross-contamination.
- [medium] The proposed dates could conflict with Priya's rota until she checks it.
- [medium] Waffles' presence could be a booking constraint because the cabin's pet policy has not been verified.
- [medium] The private-chef option would add approximately $600, or $150 per paying person, to the trip cost.
- [high] Heron Point prohibits pets and charges a $250 fee if pet hair is found, so Waffles cannot attend.
- [high] The cabin dates could be lost if the 50% deposit of $570 is not paid by Friday, September 25.
- [medium] Mia's uncertain attendance affects the per-person cost, which is currently $380 for three people and would be $285 each if she joins.
- [high] Maya's gluten-free requirement includes cross-contamination precautions such as separate kitchen equipment.
- [medium] The original October 16–19 weekend was unavailable to Speaker 1 because of three consecutive night shifts and an inability to swap again.
- [high] The surprise could be spoiled if Jonah's visit is mentioned in the birthday group chat or in jokes around Maya.
- [high] The surprise could be exposed if anyone mentions Jonah in the birthday group chat, makes jokes, or interacts with his posts because Maya notices everything.
- [high] Jonah’s transportation from the airport is not arranged, despite the cabin being about three hours from the airport.
- [medium] The group has only one reliable vehicle because Me’s car is making a noise and is not trusted for the three-hour drive.
- [medium] Food planning may be constrained because Maya is gluten-free and no nearby gluten-free grocery store has been identified.
- [low] The gift purchase depends on collecting $60 from each participant, and the total is only slightly above the $179 purchase price.

#### Follow-up draft
Subject: Follow-up: Heron Point birthday weekend

Hi team,

Thanks for the productive discussion. We aligned on Heron Point Cabin at Birchwater Lake for October 23–26, with Maya excluded from the $1,140 accommodation split, cooking instead of hiring a chef, travel in one Ridgeway SUV, and Jonah’s surprise managed only through Operation Heron. We also agreed to contribute $60 each toward the green Polaroid and to follow strict gluten-free cross-contamination precautions while accommodating Mia’s vegetarian diet. The key open question is whether Mia will attend, since that determines the final cost split and food planning.

Best,

### Title: Heron Point Cabin Birthday Weekend

#### Overview
The group caught up on Tom's new job and Priya's puppy, chose Birchwater Lake's Heron Point Cabin for Maya's 30th birthday weekend (Oct 16-19), corrected the cost to $1,140 ($285 each) with Priya to book using Hearthstay credit, and parked the private chef idea. The group moved Maya's birthday cabin trip to October 23rd-26th after Priya's night shifts blocked the 16th, dropped the $600 chef, made Dan the new booker paying the $570 deposit, and revealed Jonah's secret surprise visit. The group locked in the surprise-birthday logistics for Maya's Birchwater Lake trip — 9:30 a.m. departure from Priya's on Calloway on Friday the 23rd for three nights, one rented SUV, $60 each toward a $179 Polaroid Priya buys by October 16th — while leaving Jonah's airport transport, Mia's attendance, kayaks and the gluten-free grocery question open for the Operation Heron chat. Key decisions: Birchwater Lake's Heron Point Cabin was chosen over Hollins Ridge for the birthday trip, partly because it has a hot tub and is a shorter drive.; Trip dates were set as Friday, October 16th to Monday the 19th, the weekend before Maya's birthday.; The $1,140 total is split four ways at $285 each, with Maya not paying since it's her birthday..

#### Summary
- The group met to plan a cabin weekend for the 30th birthday of Maya, settling on Heron Point Cabin at Birchwater Lake for Friday, October 23rd to Monday the 26th, chosen over Hollins Ridge partly for its hot tub and shorter drive.
- The cabin totals just over eleven hundred dollars with a deposit of half that due Friday, September 25th, and Dan took over the booking after the expired Hearthstay credit of Priya and her previously flagged card ruled her out; the split is $380 each unless Mia confirms, which would bring it to $285 each.
- The roughly $600 private chef was dropped in favor of the group cooking for themselves, with Tom making a gluten-free lasagna on Saturday, and the stay was kept at three nights with no dogs attending; gift contributions were set at $60 each toward the $179 green Polaroid that Priya will buy, the group will ride together in one rented SUV leaving at half past nine in the morning from Calloway Street where Priya lives, planning for the surprise arrival of Jonah moved into a separate chat named Operation Heron, and Maya is celiac and strictly gluten-free while Mia is vegetarian, with cross-contamination a real concern requiring a separate toaster and chopping board.

#### What changed
- Tom revealed he quit Pellmark, with his last day on October 9th, and starts at Halvorsen Logistics on Monday, November 2nd as a senior financial analyst.
- The trip destination shifted from considering Hollins Ridge to settling on Birchwater Lake's Heron Point Cabin.
- The stated cabin cost was corrected mid-discussion from $1,040 to $1,140 after Dan noticed the missed cleaning fee at $325 a night plus fees.
- Dan flagged that his work reorg has escalated to Graham scheduling a meeting to plan the meeting, with a 22-slide deck.
- Priya reported she did a twelve and a half hour shift a day earlier because the unit was three nurses short.
- Priya said she is moving to day shifts in November, which she called light at the end of the tunnel.
- It was clarified that Maya is celiac and strictly gluten-free while Mia is the vegetarian, correcting Tom's mix-up.
- The trip was moved from the weekend of the 16th to October 23rd-26th because Priya is on Friday-Sunday night shifts the 16th weekend.
- Heron Point was confirmed open for the 23rd-26th at the same price, $1,140 total.
- The pet-friendly assumption was wrong — the listing filter was picking up nearby pet-friendly trails, not the house itself.
- Priya's credit expired on September 1st, so she handed the booking to Dan.
- Mia can't make the 23rd because of her cousin's wedding on Saturday the 24th in Portland.
- With Mia unconfirmed, the cost split rose to $380 each across three people, dropping to $285 each if she confirms.
- The deposit was found to be due Friday September 25th (not the end of the month), totaling $570 as 50%.
- Jonah, Maya's brother, plans to fly in from Denver and surprise her before dinner on Saturday the 24th.
- A separate planning chat, "Operation Heron," was created so the birthday group chat containing Maya stays clean.
- Departure time shifted from 8 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., because showing up at 8 would risk Maya cancelling her own birthday.
- The meet-up point is now fixed as Priya's place on Calloway Street, chosen because it is in the middle for everyone.
- The gift per-person contribution was raised from $50 to $60 after the Polaroid turned out to cost $179.
- Trip length was settled at three nights, Friday the 23rd to Monday the 26th, after Tom floated extending to four nights through Tuesday.
- Transport changed from Tom's separate-car idea to a single rented SUV for the whole group.
- Tom's booking commitment got a date: the Ridgeway SUV is to be booked by October 1st.
- Priya was given a concrete gift deadline of ordering the Polaroid by October 16th so it arrives in time.
- Dan confirmed he is booking the cabin and covering the $570 deposit before Friday.
- The remaining unknowns were explicitly deferred out of the call into the Operation Heron chat.

#### Decisions
- Birchwater Lake's Heron Point Cabin was chosen, with the hot tub cited as the deciding factor.
- The trip was set for Friday, October 16th to Monday the 19th, three nights, the weekend before Maya's birthday.
- The cost is split four ways among Dan, Priya, Tom and (likely) Mia Chen at $285 each, with Maya not paying.
- Priya was assigned to make the booking, applying her roughly $150 Hearthstay credit from the cancelled Lisbon trip.
- The private chef idea was deferred rather than approved.
- Trip dates confirmed as October 23rd to 26th.
- No private chef; the group will cook for themselves.
- Waffles will not come; Priya will ask her sister to take him.
- Dan is the booker and will pay the deposit; Priya and Tom reimburse $190 each.
- Tom cooks Saturday dinner (gluten-free lasagna).
- Group gift budget is $50 each toward the green Polaroid camera.
- Tom rents a seven-seater car ('something big enough for five, in case Mia comes').
- Jonah's surprise stays off the birthday group chat; a separate 'Operation Heron' chat handles it.
- Only three people are in the loop for the Jonah surprise, and the planning chat is named Operation Heron.
- No one is to like or react to Jonah's posts, because Maya notices everything.
- Tom will book the Ridgeway SUV by October 1st, with no 8 a.m. pickup.
- Departure is 9:30 a.m. on Friday the 23rd, from Priya's place on Calloway Street, with Tom picking up the SUV first and collecting Maya en route.
- The group rides together in one car rather than splitting into separate vehicles.
- Gift cost is $60 per person ($180 total) to cover the $179 Polaroid, and Priya will purchase it.
- If Mia joins, she handles the card and flowers instead of chipping in cash.
- The stay stays at three nights, Friday the 23rd to Monday the 26th, rather than four nights to Tuesday.
- No dogs on the trip.
- Maya is gluten-free and Mia is vegetarian — dietary constraints recorded for the trip.

#### Action items
- Priya to book the Heron Point Cabin on Hearthstay for the Oct 16-19 weekend.
- Priya to check her work rota later to confirm the dates work.
- Dan to double-check the listing's pet policy so Priya can bring Waffles.
- Dan to pull up the listing properly to verify the pet thing at the end of the call.
- Someone (unassigned) to check for a nearby grocery store stocking gluten-free items for Maya.
- Priya to ask sister Anjali to take Waffles that weekend.
- Dan to book the cabin before Friday, probably tomorrow.
- Priya to Venmo her $190 tonight.
- Tom to send his $190 by Wednesday.
- Priya to get a proper yes or no from Mia by Sunday.
- Priya to look up the Polaroid camera price.
- Priya to add the others to Operation Heron after the call.
- Priya adds the other two participants to the Operation Heron chat right after the call.
- Tom books the Ridgeway SUV by October 1st and is asked to avoid an 8 a.m. pickup.
- Tom picks up the SUV and then meets everyone at Priya's on Calloway at 9:30 on Friday the 23rd.
- Tom collects Maya on the way, since she lives two streets over from him.
- Dan books the cabin and pays the $570 deposit before Friday.
- Priya orders the green Polaroid by October 16th so it definitely arrives in time.
- Everyone sends Priya $60 for the gift.
- Priya pays Dan the $190 she owes, promising to do it tonight.
- A playlist for the drive still needs an owner — Tom is explicitly excluded and Dan only committed to "we'll see."
- The open items — Mia, Jonah's transport, kayaks and the gluten-free grocery run — are to be sorted in the Operation Heron chat.

#### Open questions
- Whether Waffles can attend depends on confirming the listing is pet friendly.
- Priya's availability for the Oct 16-19 weekend is unconfirmed pending her rota.
- The private chef for Saturday night remains undecided given the ~$600 cost and $150-per-person implication.
- The overall food plan for the weekend (cooking the whole time vs. chef) was raised but not resolved.
- Cake remains a maybe — order Crumb and Kettle's gluten-free (dry last time) or bake one at the cabin.
- Kayak rental on Birchwater (~$45/person for a half day) left undecided for in-person choice.
- Whether Mia can join, possibly just the Sunday, is unresolved pending her reply.
- Friday departure time not settled; Tom proposed an 8 a.m. pickup.
- Whether a nearby grocery store stocks gluten-free food for Maya was raised but not assigned.
- How Jonah gets from the airport to the Birchwater cabin, roughly three hours away, is still unresolved — Jonah said he would figure it out.
- Whether Mia is coming at all remains open.
- Kayaks are still only a maybe for the trip.
- Nobody has verified whether there is a gluten-free store near Birchwater for the groceries.
- Late-October weather for the cabin cannot be forecast yet; the group is working off typical conditions of about fifty degrees by day and near freezing at night.

#### Risks / blockers
- Maya's celiac condition makes cross-contamination a genuine risk, requiring a separate toaster and chopping board.
- Priya's shift pattern could block her from the chosen dates until her rota is checked.
- The private chef would add about $150 per person, which Tom himself called insane once said aloud.
- Pet-friendliness of the cabin is unverified, risking that Waffles cannot come.
- The Wanderers' goalkeeper's return is unreliable, having promised to come back the week before too.
- Priya's expired credit and previously flagged card block her from booking, shifting the task to Dan.
- The $570 deposit deadline is Friday September 25th; missing it drops the hold on the dates.
- Cost per person is $380 unless Mia confirms, which Priya acknowledged with a resigned 'Oof.'
- A $250 pet-hair fee applies if any evidence is found at Heron Point.
- Jonah's surprise risks leaking since the birthday group chat includes Maya.
- The group has only one car and it will be parked at the lake, leaving Jonah's transfer from the airport unsolved.
- Dan's car has a recurring noise problem and he does not trust it for three hours each way, which is part of why the group consolidated onto one rental.
- The $179 Polaroid breaks the $150 assumption — the original $50-each plan would have fallen short.
- Surprise integrity is fragile: Maya notices everything, so nobody may interact with Jonah's posts and his name must not appear outside Operation Heron.
- Tom has a prior record of spoiling surprises — he told Priya about her own surprise party while standing next to her — prompting extra secrecy rules.
- Extending to four nights is blocked because Priya is back on shift Tuesday morning.
- An extra night would cost another $325 or more.
- Dietary logistics are unsecured — Maya is gluten-free and Mia vegetarian, but no one has checked for a gluten-free store near Birchwater.
- Cold weather risk: late October at Birchwater is typically around fifty degrees by day and near freezing at night, so real layers are required.

#### Notes
- Priya's beagle Waffles is eleven weeks old and has already eaten two phone chargers and one of her work clogs, leaving her with a single clog.
- Waffles starts puppy class next Saturday with a trainer named Brenda who formerly trained police dogs.
- The Hollins Ridge option was rejected largely because it is about four and a half hours away versus roughly three for Birchwater, and a prior trip there had a broken heater.
- Four paying attendees were identified: Dan, Priya, Tom, and Mia Chen, who said she is probably in.
- The relevant Mia is Mia Chen from Priya's book club; Maya's work colleague Mia moved to London.
- Tom's private-chef reference was his cousin, who paid around $600 for a five-course dinner where the chef also did all the dishes.
- Maya was described as the most organized of the group, having kept a color-coded calendar since freshman year.
- The Wanderers lost six-two on Tuesday with Tom in goal for the second half, conceding four goals.
- Dan's reorg deck reportedly has 22 slides, including one that just says "Alignment" in huge letters.
- Priya spoiled the Harbor Lights finale for Tom, who was two episodes behind, and would not accept Dan's defense that the sudden death was intentional.
- Priya is on nights Friday-Sunday the 16th weekend and has already swapped twice this month, so she can't swap again.
- Maya has a big work presentation on Friday the 16th, which Priya thinks means she'd prefer the later date.
- The remaining $570 balance auto-charges two weeks before check-in.
- Tom's new Halvorsen role starts November 2nd, is hybrid (two days from home), and pays for a CFA level-two certification, with no signing bonus.
- Tom's Halvorsen interview was five rounds; the final case study had a warehouse budget and forty minutes, and his laptop died halfway so he finished on a whiteboard.
- Dan's rent goes up $200/month at his January lease renewal, and he's looking at a fourth-floor walk-up near the river, scanning about six listings a night.
- Dan, Priya and Tom discussed a TV show whose ratings dropped after season two when it moved to Thursdays, with talk it might not get a fourth season.
- Priya shared a hospital anecdote about a man who glued his hand to a ladder he was fixing while standing on it; the ladder stayed in the ambulance bay for about three hours.
- Jonah has not seen Maya since the summer before last — about fourteen months — when he moved to Denver, and Maya keeps saying she misses him.
- The trip location is Birchwater Lake, Heron Point, Friday the 23rd to Monday the 26th.
- The Polaroid being bought is the green one at $179.
- Late October conditions at the lake are typically around fifty degrees during the day and near freezing at night, which Tom called perfect hot tub weather.
- Priya lives on Calloway Street, chosen as the meeting point because it is in the middle for everyone.
- Tom explicitly stated he is unemployed, which is why he floated a longer trip.
- Priya owes Dan $190 and he reminded her of it at the end of the call.
- Tom's fleece came up as a packing joke — Priya said it has a hole and Dan noted it is from a charity 5K in 2019.
- Maya and Jonah have not been in contact in person since he moved, which Priya framed as the reason the surprise is "so perfect."
- Tom recited back the full plan — Birchwater Lake, Heron Point, Friday the 23rd to Monday the 26th — plus the SUV booking and the 9:30 meet-up, to confirm he had it right.
- The call ended with Tom leaving early because of a barking dog next door.

- Birchwater Lake's Heron Point Cabin was chosen over Hollins Ridge for the birthday trip, partly because it has a hot tub and is a shorter drive.

- The private chef idea for Saturday night was parked rather than agreed.
- The cabin trip for Maya's birthday is moved to October 23rd-26th.
- The $600 private chef is dropped; the group will cook their own meals.
- Heron Point does not allow pets, so Priya's dog Waffles will not attend.
- Dan will book the cabin on his card instead of Priya.
- Tom will cook Saturday dinner, a gluten-free lasagna.
- The group gift is set at $50 each toward the green Polaroid camera.
- Tom will rent a seven-seater car for the trip.
- A separate chat called 'Operation Heron' will be created to keep Jonah's surprise secret.
- Dan pays the full $570 deposit; Priya and Tom each send him $190.
- Cake and kayaking were left as open 'maybes' to decide later rather than resolved.
- All planning for Jonah's surprise arrival is moved into a separate chat named "Operation Heron," and nothing about Jonah is to be mentioned anywhere else, including jokes. (owner: Priya)
- The group will leave at 9:30 a.m. rather than 8 a.m. because Maya is not a morning person.
- Everyone meets at Priya's place on Calloway Street at 9:30 a.m. on Friday the 23rd, with Tom picking up the SUV first.
- The group takes one car (the rented SUV) rather than driving separately.
- Gift contributions are set at $60 each ($180 total) instead of $50 each, so the $179 Polaroid is covered.
- Priya will buy the Polaroid gift and order it by October 16th so it arrives in time. (owner: Priya)
- The trip stays at three nights, Friday the 23rd to Monday the 26th; Tom's idea of four nights through Tuesday is rejected.
- No dogs on the trip.
- If Mia comes, she is assigned the card and flowers rather than a cash contribution.
- Dan is booking the cabin and paying the $570 deposit before Friday. (owner: Dan)

#### Open questions (structured)
- Can Waffles come to the cabin — is the rental actually pet friendly? [open]
- Will Priya's rota allow her to take the Oct 16-19 dates off? [open]
- Is the private chef for the Saturday birthday dinner worth the roughly $600 cost ($150 each)? [open]
- Is the Wanderers goalkeeper actually back next week? [open]
- What is the food plan for the trip — are they cooking the whole time? [open]
- Whether to order the cake from Crumb and Kettle or bake one up at the cabin. [open]
- Whether to rent kayaks on Birchwater in late October. [open]

- How is Jonah actually getting from the airport to the cabin, since Birchwater is about three hours from the airport? [open]
- Is Mia coming on the trip at all? [open]
- Are kayaks happening — still listed as only a maybe? [open]
- Has anyone checked whether there's a gluten-free store near Birchwater? [open]
- What will the weather be in late October — the forecast does not extend that far yet? [open]

#### Risks (structured)
- [high] Maya is celiac and strictly gluten-free, so cross-contamination is a real concern requiring separate toaster and chopping board.
- [medium] Priya's attendance depends on her rota, which has not yet been confirmed.
- [medium] A private chef at roughly $600 would add about $150 per person on top of the cabin cost.
- [low] Confusion over Maya vs Mia's dietary needs risked wrong food planning; Tom regularly mixes up Maya and Mia.
- [low] The previous Hollins Ridge trip had a broken heater and a four-and-a-half-hour drive that Priya refuses to repeat.
- [high] Priya's credit expired on September 1st and her card was flagged last time she booked, so she cannot make the reservation herself.
- [high] The $570 deposit (50%) is due by Friday, September 25th, after which the hold on the dates drops.
- [medium] Cost per person rises to $380 each if Mia does not confirm.
- [medium] A $250 fee applies if pet hair is found at Heron Point.
- [medium] Jonah's surprise must stay secret, since the birthday group chat includes Maya.
- [low] The trip is now two days after Maya's actual birthday, accepted as still within her birthday week.
- [high] There is only one car in the group and it will be sitting at the lake, making the airport-to-cabin leg for Jonah unresolved.
- [medium] Dan's own car is making 'that noise again' and he doesn't trust it for a three-hour drive each way.
- [medium] The $179 Polaroid exceeds the $150 assumption, so the original $50-each split did not cover it.
- [high] Surprise secrecy risk: Maya notices everything, so no one may like or react to Jonah's posts and nothing about him may leak outside Operation Heron.
- [medium] Past spoiler behaviour risk: Tom previously told Priya about her own surprise party while standing next to her, which is why the group is reinforcing secrecy.
- [medium] Priya cannot extend the trip to Tuesday because she is back on shift Tuesday morning.
- [low] A fourth night would add another $325 or more in cost.
- [medium] Dietary constraints are not yet secured: Maya is gluten-free and Mia is vegetarian, and no gluten-free store near Birchwater has been checked.
- [low] Late-October conditions at the cabin are likely around 50°F in the day and near freezing at night, so layered clothing is required.

#### Follow-up draft
Subject: Follow-up: Maya's 30th birthday cabin weekend at Heron Point

Hi all,

Thanks for the time today — good to have the cabin weekend pinned down. We've settled on Heron Point at Birchwater Lake for Friday, October 23rd through Monday the 26th, three nights, with Dan booking and covering the $570 deposit before Friday. We're skipping the private chef and cooking ourselves, with Tom doing a gluten-free lasagna on Saturday, everyone chipping in $60 toward the Polaroid Priya is ordering, and a 9:30 a.m. meet-up at Priya's on Calloway to head up together in one rented SUV. Anything to do with the surprise arrival stays in the Operation Heron chat so the birthday thread stays clean.

The one thing still open is whether Mia can make it, since that decides whether we're at $380 each across three or $285 each across four.

Best,

### Title: Maya's 30th Birthday Cabin Weekend

#### Overview
Friends caught up on personal news (Tom's new job, Priya's puppy), then planned Maya's 30th birthday cabin weekend — settling on Birchwater Lake/Heron Point for Oct 16–19 at $1,140 total, with Priya to book using Hearthstay credit. The group reworked the cabin weekend to October 23-26 after Priya's night rota conflicted, dropped the $600 chef, and planned a secret surprise arrival by Maya's brother Jonah. The group finalized logistics for Maya's surprise birthday weekend at Birchwater Lake (Heron Point, Fri Oct 23–Mon Oct 26), settling on $60 each for the gift, one rented SUV, a 9:30 pickup at Priya's, and leaving unresolved issues to a new 'Operation Heron' chat.

- The correct cabin total is $1,140 (was initially said as $1,040) at $325/night plus fees.
- The cabin weekend moved from the 16th to October 23rd-26th because Priya is on nights Friday-Sunday of the 16th and cannot swap.
- The $600 chef was cut, saving the group roughly half the cabin cost; they will cook themselves.
- The pet-friendly assumption was wrong; Heron Point bans all pets with a $250 fee for pet hair, so Waffles is not coming.
- Mia cannot make the 23rd due to her cousin's wedding on Saturday the 24th in Portland; she may come Sunday but isn't sure.
- With three people confirmed, the trip cost is now $380 each instead of $285 each, dropping back to $285 if Mia confirms.
- Tom's new job at Halvorsen starts November 2nd, is hybrid (two days from home), and includes paid CFA level two certification but no signing bonus.
- A separate chat called 'Operation Heron' was created to plan the surprise away from Maya.
- Gift budget moved from $50 each to $60 each after finding the green Polaroid at $179.
- Departure time was pushed from 8 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. so Maya wouldn't cancel her own birthday.
- Travel plan switched from potentially two cars to a single shared car.
- Trip length was kept at three nights rather than Speaker 2's proposed four nights.

#### Decisions
- Birchwater Lake / Heron Point Cabin chosen over Hollins Ridge for the birthday weekend.
- Priya will book the cabin using her ~$150 Hearthstay credit.
- Maya doesn't pay; cost split among Dan, Priya, Tom and Mia.
- Private chef for Saturday night parked for now.
- Confirmed the cabin weekend as October 23rd to 26th at Heron Point at the same price of $1,140 total.
- Agreed no chef and the group will cook; Tom will make gluten-free lasagna for Saturday dinner.
- Deferred the cake decision to a maybe (order from Crumb and Kettle vs. bake).
- Left kayak rentals as a maybe to decide once at the cabin.
- Confirmed a $50-each group gift as the target, with the green Polaroid camera as the leading idea.
- Agreed Tom will rent a seven-seater car and pick everyone up, with timing to be figured out later.
- Agreed to keep Jonah's surprise completely secret in a separate 'Operation Heron' chat, not even jokes in the main group.
- Nothing about Jonah goes anywhere except Operation Heron — not even jokes.
- Priya will buy the gift and order it by October 16th.
- Everyone sends Priya $60 for the gift.
- Meet at Priya's place on Calloway Street at 9:30 on Friday the 23rd, with Tom picking up the SUV first.
- No dogs on the trip; Maya is gluten-free and Mia is vegetarian.
- Open items will be sorted out in the Operation Heron chat.

#### Action items
- Priya to book Heron Point Cabin on Hearthstay after checking her rota.
- Dan to double-check the pet-friendly status of the listing.
- Someone to check for a nearby grocery store with gluten-free options.
- Priya will ask her sister Anjali to take Waffles for the cabin weekend.

- Priya will Venmo her $190 tonight; Tom will send his $190 by Wednesday.
- Tom will make a gluten-free lasagna for Saturday dinner at the cabin.
- Tom will rent a seven-seater car (Ridgeway SUVs around $64/day).
- Priya will look up the price of the green Polaroid camera for the gift.
- Priya will add Dan and Tom to the 'Operation Heron' chat after the call.
- Speaker 2 books the Ridgeway SUV by October 1st.
- Speaker 2 picks up Maya on the way, two streets over from him.
- Me books the rental and pays the $570 deposit before Friday.
- If Mia comes, she can handle the card and flowers.
- Speaker 1 promised to pay the $190 owed tonight.

#### Open questions
- Is the cabin pet-friendly so Waffles can attend?
- Whether to book a private chef (~$600) for Saturday night.
- Does Priya's rota allow the Oct 16–19 dates?
- Whether to order a gluten-free cake from Crumb and Kettle (Priya found their GF version dry) or bake at the cabin — noted as a maybe.
- Whether the group will actually rent kayaks given late-October cold water.
- Whether Mia will confirm any part of the trip, with Tom pushing for a real answer rather than waiting.
- What departure time the group will actually use on Friday.
- How Jonah gets from the airport to the cabin remains unresolved, and he said he'd figure it out himself.
- Whether Mia is coming is still open.
- Kayaks remain a maybe.
- Nobody has checked for a gluten-free store near Birchwater.
- No one has volunteered to make the drive playlist.

#### Risks / blockers
- Maya's celiac condition means strict gluten-free and anti-cross-contamination measures are required for any meals.
- Priya's rota may conflict with the proposed cabin dates.
- Different dietary needs across the group: Mia is vegetarian, Maya is gluten-free.
- Pets are banned at Heron Point with a $250 pet hair fee, so the pet-friendly listing filter was misleading.
- Priya's card situation (expired credit September 1st, flagged card) forces Dan to be the booker.
- The $570 deposit is due by Friday September 25th or the hold on the dates is released.
- Cross-contamination risk for Maya's gluten-free needs requires separate toaster and chopping board.
- Priya cannot swap her night shifts because she has already swapped twice this month.
- Mia possibly not attending raises the per-person cost to $380 each.
- Only one car is available and it will be sitting at the lake, complicating Jonah's airport-to-cabin transport.
- Dan's car has recurring noise and isn't trusted for a three-hour drive each way.
- Maya notices everything, so any leak or likes on Jonah's posts could spoil the surprise.
- Late October nights at Birchwater are near freezing, requiring real layers.
- A four-night stay would cost another $325 plus and Speaker 1 can't do Tuesday due to a shift.

#### Notes
- Hollins Ridge was rejected as too far at ~4.5 hours drive vs Birchwater's ~3 hours; last trip there had an album on repeat and a broken heater.
- Heron Point Cabin has three bedrooms, sleeps six, is right on the water, and has a hot tub.
- Cost after correction is $285 each across four paying attendees.
- Maya turns 30 on Wednesday, October 21st; plan remains a three-night cabin weekend.
- Priya starts puppy class with Waffles next Saturday under trainer Brenda.
- Dan's work reorg includes a pre-meeting with a 22-slide deck led by Graham.
- There are two Mias (book club Mia Chen and Maya's work Mia who moved to London), causing confusion.
- Dietary restrictions noted: Maya is gluten-free, Mia is vegetarian.
- Priya's dog Waffles will 'eat a charger in your honor' rather than come to the cabin.
- Priya thinks Maya would prefer the weekend after her birthday because she has a big work presentation Friday the 16th.
- Dan's rent is rising $200 a month at lease renewal in January, prompting an apartment hunt of about six listings a night; a river place is a fourth-floor walk-up.
- Tom's Halvorsen interview was five rounds, including a 40-minute warehouse-budget case study where his laptop and whiteboard marker both died mid-task.
- Priya recounted a patient who glued his hand to a ladder and calmly asked if they could save the ladder; the ladder stayed in the ambulance bay about three hours.
- The remaining $570 balance will be charged automatically two weeks before check-in.
- Jonah lands Saturday the 24th in the afternoon and wants to walk in right before dinner to surprise Maya.
- Maya believes the weekend is just the four of them having a quiet birthday trip.
- Jonah hasn't seen Maya in about fourteen months, since he moved to Denver, and she keeps saying she misses him.
- Priya's place on Calloway Street was chosen as the meeting point because it's in the middle for everyone.
- Late October weather at Birchwater is usually around fifty during the day and near freezing at night.
- Speaker 2 praised the timing as the perfect hot tub weather.
- A running joke referenced Tom having previously told Priya about her own surprise party while standing next to him.
- The green Polaroid costs $179, which is more than the $150 the original $50-each plan covered.

#### Follow-up draft
Subject: Follow-up: Maya's birthday cabin weekend at Heron Point

Hi all,

Thanks for a fun call catching up and getting the cabin weekend sorted. We landed on Birchwater Lake, specifically Heron Point Cabin, for Friday October 23rd to Monday the 26th, at $1,140 total; the chef is dropped and we'll cook ourselves, Tom's on gluten-free lasagna for Saturday, we're each putting in $60 for the green Polaroid, and we'll meet at Priya's place on Calloway Street at 9:30 on the Friday for one shared seven-seater.

The main thing still open is Mia — Priya, if you can get a real yes or no from her by Sunday, then we'll know whether we're at $285 or $380 each before the cabin gets booked. Everything else can wait for the Operation Heron chat.

Best,

---

### Title: Maya’s Birthday Weekend at Heron Point

- The group lacks a reliable backup vehicle because the existing car is making a noise.

#### Follow-up draft
Subject: Follow-up: Heron Point birthday weekend

Hi team,

Thanks for the thoughtful discussion on Maya’s birthday weekend. We aligned on Heron Point Cabin at Birchwater Lake for October 23–26, with three nights, one SUV departing from Priya’s at 9:30 on Friday, no dogs or private chef, and the $1,140 cabin cost split at $285 among the four paying participants; Jonah’s surprise planning will remain in Operation Heron. The most important open question is how Jonah will get from the airport to the cabin, alongside confirming a safe gluten-free grocery option for Maya.

Best,
